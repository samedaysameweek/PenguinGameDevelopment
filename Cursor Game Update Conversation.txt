I have been developing a game in gamemaker studio and have provided the entire projects codebase in the form of combined gml object and script gml code files. Major progress has been made on the project thank to all of the contributions of a variety of LLM AI like yourself. 

I was adding in a save/load system and was having trouble with the room states saving and loading correctly, I then added a polar bear npc into the game and made several updates and changes to the projects overall code base, this has introduced a few bugs.

I think a full analysis of the project is in order, I want you to compare and review the games current development status with the game design outline document.

Development has been achieved, currently, by using a scripts to combine the txt from all the .gml files in the projects objects and scripts folder and sub folders. This creates the combined gml and gml scripts files and I have been sharing the entire games combined gml files with various AI LLM's. As the project has gotten bigger I have noticed the txt file sizes getting larger and larger as development has continued, I was thinking of breaking the games various objects and various system logic into sections so when developing I only need upload relevant sections that are currently being developed, What do you think about my current workflow and ideas to improve it also?

Can you analyse the entire project so you have the fullest clearest understanding of the projects various objects and there relationships with each other, use the combined files to quickly locate specific objects events or scripts, once a full lookover has been completed I want you to come up with a plan to introduce better standards and can more easily and effectively brainstorm and plan out the relevant and essential changes needed to improve the codes readability, error handling and debugging as well as make it easier to work on with an LLM. @combined_gml_files.txt @combined_gml_scripts_files.txt @Game Development Outline.txt @Penguin Isles 

I'll help analyze your project and provide recommendations for improving your workflow. Let me break this down into several sections:
First, let me analyze the current codebase structure and implementation status compared to the game design outline.
Let me search through the codebase to understand the current implementation:

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or provide more specific implementation details for any particular system?
I would like you to implement this plan; Code Readability

Issue: Inconsistent naming conventions and formatting reduce readability.
Solution: Standardize naming conventions for variables, functions, and scripts (e.g., use camelCase for variables, PascalCase for scripts).
Error Handling

Issue: Error handling is sometimes reactive (e.g., logs warnings but does not gracefully recover).
Solution: Introduce fallback mechanisms where possible (e.g., default values for undefined variables).
Debugging and Logging

Issue: Debug logs are verbose but lack categorization.
Solution: Use tagged logs to distinguish between errors, warnings, and info (e.g., [ERROR], [INFO], [DEBUG]).
Global Variable Management

Issue: Heavy reliance on global variables increases the risk of unintended side effects.
Solution: Encapsulate globals into structs or dedicated manager objects.
Room State and Save/Load System

Issue: Room state management and save/load interactions are tightly coupled, leading to potential bugs.
Solution: Decouple room state management from other systems for better modularity.
AI Collaboration

Issue: The current structure, while modular, can be overwhelming for AI tools to analyze.
Solution: Break down combined files into smaller, more focused files for targeted analysis. Phase 1: Implement Specific Improvements
Standardize Naming Conventions

Update variable names, function names, and script names to follow the proposed camelCase, snake_case, and PascalCase conventions.
Introduce Debugging Tags

Enhance existing debug logs with tags like [INFO], [ERROR], [DEBUG] for better traceability.
Implement Default Values and Error Handling

Add default values for undefined variables and check for potential errors in scripts.
Refactor Room State Management

Decouple room state management into a dedicated RoomStateManager script.
Phase 2: Reorganize Files
Categorize Files by Functionality

Create directories such as player_scripts, inventory_scripts, room_management, etc.
Break down the combined files into smaller, focused files.
Improve File Naming

Use descriptive and consistent names for files to make them easier to locate and understand.

I'll help implement this plan, starting with standardizing the code structure and error handling. Let's begin with the most critical improvements:
First, let's create a new error handling and logging system:
Now let's create a global state manager to better handle global variables:
Let's update the room state management to be more modular:
These initial improvements provide:
Structured error logging with severity levels
Centralized global state management
More robust room state handling
Would you like me to continue with the remaining improvements, such as:
Standardizing the inventory system
Improving the save/load system
Implementing better player state management
Creating a UI state manager
Let me know which area you'd like me to focus on next!
Yes please continue,

I'll continue by implementing the inventory system improvements and UI state management. Let's create these new systems:
First, let's create a standardized inventory management system:
Now let's create a UI state manager:
Let's create an initialization script to tie everything together:
These new systems provide:
Structured inventory management with proper error handling
Centralized UI state management
Proper system initialization and cleanup
To use these systems, you would:
Initialize everything in your game start:
Use the inventory system:
Manage UI:
Would you like me to continue with:
Save/Load system improvements
Player state management
Quest system implementation
Or something else?
continue on with the save/load system now

I'll create an improved save/load system that works with our new state management structure:
This improved save/load system:

Includes auto-save functionality
Uses the new logging system
Works with the global state manager
To use this system:
Add it to the SystemInitializer:
Call auto-save check in a controller object's Step event:
Save/Load on demand:
Would you like me to continue with:
Player state management
Quest system implementation
Or something else?
Looks good, please move on to player state management

I'll create a player state management system that handles player data, animations, and actions in a more organized way:
This player management system:
Centralizes all player-related state
Handles movement and collision
Manages actions and animations
Uses proper error handling and logging
Integrates with the global state system
To use this system:
Initialize it with other systems:
Update it in the controller object:
Start player actions:
Would you like me to continue with:

Reward system
Integration with inventory and logging systems
To use this system:
Initialize it with other systems:
Start a quest:
Update quest progress:
Would you like me to continue with:
NPC interaction system
Dialog system
Or something else?
@outputlog.txt I have decided to finally test my project after all the recent changes and when I did I found that the game crashed after the player chose their colour.

Looking at the error log, I can see the specific issue:
Apply to outputlog.tx...
The crash is happening because the game is trying to call load_room_state() but this function doesn't exist or isn't accessible. This is likely due to recent refactoring where we moved room state management into the new RoomStateManager system but didn't update all the existing code references.
Let's fix this by updating the obj_controller's Room Start event:
This update:
Replaces the old load_room_state() call with the new RoomStateManager_LoadState()
Maintains all the existing player spawning and room transition logic
Adds more detailed debug logging
Properly handles room state loading in both fresh load and normal room transition scenarios
Make sure you have properly initialized the RoomStateManager in your game start:
This should resolve the crash and maintain proper room state management. Let me know if you need any clarification or run into other issues!
Ok, I tested the game again and it crashed in the same place again, Ive updated the output log for you to review, I think considering all the recent code refactoring, there will be a other objects and systems that need their references updated also@outputlog.txt @Penguin Isles 

I'll analyze the updated output log to find the issue and check for other potential reference problems:
Let me read the correct file:
Let's check if the obj_controller script has been updated:
Let's check the script state to see if our RoomStateManager script exists:
Great, I see the issue now. The updated obj_controller script is trying to use RoomStateManager_LoadState, which we've created, but it's not actually being included in the project compile process. I need to see if there's an obj_game_controller (where we're initializing our systems) that actually exists:
I now understand the problem. There are two issues:
We created scripts/system/RoomStateManager.gml, but the system is being initialized in obj_game_controller, which is not the main controller in your game.
The obj_controller's Room Start event is trying to use RoomStateManager_LoadState, but this function isn't available because obj_game_controller isn't being used.
Let's fix this by:
Creating proper script functions in the existing RoomStateManager for backward compatibility
Updating obj_controller's Create event to initialize our new systems
Let's read obj_controller's Create event to see where we should initialize our systems:
Now I see the complete picture. Here's what I need to do:
Create a backward compatibility function in RoomStateManager to fix the error
Update obj_controller to initialize our new systems
Let's create these files:
Now we need to update obj_controller's Create event to initialize our systems:
For the game to find and use the new RoomStateManager script, let's create a simplified version that we know will work with the current code:
These changes should solve the immediate crash and provide a solid foundation for your refactored codebase:
The load_room_state script provides backward compatibility
The updated RoomStateManager script works with your existing room_states data structure
The obj_controller Create event now initializes our new systems if they exist
To implement these changes:
Create the scripts/load_room_state/load_room_state.gml file
Update scripts/system/RoomStateManager.gml to match our revised version
Update the obj_controller Create event to include the new system initialization
This approach allows for a smoother transition to the new architecture while maintaining compatibility with your existing code.
Would you like me to implement any of these changes now, or would you prefer another approach?
Thank you for your overview, can you implement all of these changes now?

I'll implement all the changes as discussed. Let me provide you with the complete files that you can directly add to your project:
1. First, create the backward compatibility script:
2. Create the updated RoomStateManager script:
3. Update obj_controller's Create event:
Here's the code you should add to the beginning of your obj_controller Create event, right after the static data initialization:
4. For completeness, here's the ErrorLogger script:
Implementation Steps:
In GameMaker Studio 2:
Create a script called "load_room_state" and paste the first code block
Create a folder called "system" in your scripts folder if it doesn't exist
Create scripts "RoomStateManager" and "ErrorLogger" in the system folder
Update your obj_controller Create event with the new code at the beginning
These changes will provide backward compatibility while setting up the new architecture.
After successfully implementing these changes, you can gradually migrate more systems to the new architecture.
Let me know if you need any clarification or run into any issues with implementing these changes!
Alright, I updated the projects codebase correctly and tested the game again, the error has changed so I updated the output log so you can review the new error, I think there are more object events with code references that need to be updated, check again.@outputlog.txt @Penguin Isles 

Let me analyze the updated output log to identify the new error:
Now I see the issue. The error has moved from Room Start to Room End. We need to update the obj_controller's Room End event to use our new system or provide proper backward compatibility. Let's check the contents of the Room End event:
Now I see the problem. We need to update the Room End event to use RoomStateManager_SaveState or provide proper backward compatibility. Let's create an updated version of the Room End event:
Now let's update the obj_controller's Room End event to use our new system:
The changes look good. Now let's update obj_controller's Other_4 (Room Start) event to match our new implementation:
To maintain consistency, let's also create a backward compatibility load_room_state function:
Now let's update the Room Start event to use our backward compatibility check:
The changes look good! Let's make sure the obj_controller's Create event has proper system initialization:
Perfect! The systems initialization is already in place. Your game should now work properly with the updated code structure:
We've created backward compatibility functions for both loading and saving room state
We've updated both obj_controller Room Start and Room End events to use the new architecture while maintaining backward compatibility
The system initialization is already in place in the Create event
These changes should resolve the error you were seeing and allow the game to run smoothly. The key improvements are:
Using standardized error logging and format
Properly checking for script existence before trying to use them
Providing fallbacks for backward compatibility
Using structured room state saving and loading
Would you like me to make any additional changes or improvements to the code?
@outputlog.txt Ive tested the new code additions and updated the output log again, take a look at the updated combined file to more quickly parse through and locate essential code @combined_gml_files.txt @combined_gml_scripts_files.txt @Penguin Isles 

Okay, I'll analyze the latest error log and the combined files to pinpoint the issue.
It seems the error has shifted again, but it's still within the obj_controller's Room Start event (Other_4). The specific error is:
Apply to outputlog.tx...
This means the game is trying to read the face variable from an obj_spawn_point instance (spawn), but that variable doesn't exist on the specific spawn point instance being checked.
Let's examine the relevant section of obj_controller's Room Start event:
Apply to outputlog.tx...
The problem occurs on line 69 when trying to access spawn.face. While the nullish coalescing operator (?? DOWN) provides a fallback if spawn.face is undefined, it doesn't protect against the variable not existing at all, which is the cause of the crash.
To fix this, we need to explicitly check if the face variable exists on the spawn instance before attempting to read it.
I'll update the obj_controller's Room Start event (Other_4) with this check.
This change adds a check using variable_instance_exists(spawn, "face") before trying to read spawn.face. If the variable doesn't exist, it defaults the start_face to DOWN and logs a message, preventing the crash.
Please test the game again with this update. This should resolve the face variable error.
@outputlog.txt Ok looks good, the game is still crashing but the error is different. (I want to remind you of the player skin switching system, im not sure if this and previous errors are related but the player uses the controller to manage certain systems but the player typically plays as obj_player and can switch skins into an icetruck or tube) sorry for the tangent I dont know if its important

Okay, let's examine the latest output log to understand the new crash and how it might relate to the skin switching system.
You're right, the crash is still happening in the obj_controller Room Start event (Other_4), but the cause is different now.
The error message is:
Apply to outputlog.tx...
This indicates that when the game tries to create the player instance, the global variable global.current_skin hasn't been assigned a value yet. This is directly related to the skin-switching system you mentioned. We need to ensure global.current_skin is properly initialized before this line is reached.
Looking at the code in Penguin Isles/objects/obj_controller/Other_4.gml around line 90:
Apply to outputlog.tx...
The most likely reason for global.current_skin being unset here is during the initial game start (a new game). While init_globals sets defaults, the obj_controller's Create event might not have run yet or might not guarantee global.current_skin is set before the first Room Start event triggers.
Let's ensure global.current_skin has a default value right before we try to use it in the Room Start event.
This modification adds a safety check before line 90. It verifies if global.current_skin exists and has a value. If not (which likely happens on the very first room start of a new game), it defaults global.current_skin to "player". It also includes a more robust fallback in case the object derived from the skin name doesn't exist.
This should prevent the crash related to global.current_skin being unset. Please test the game again with this update.
@outputlog.txt  looks good, I tested the changes and while the error still occurs its because of the inventory now

Okay, let's look at the new error log to see what's happening with the inventory system.
Alright, the new error is:
Apply to outputlog.tx...
This crash occurs in the Step event of obj_inventory. The code is trying to read the global variable global.chat_active, but it hasn't been initialized yet.
This is similar to the previous global.current_skin issue. We need to ensure global.chat_active is initialized before obj_inventory's Step event runs for the first time.
The best place to initialize game-state flags like this is often in the obj_controller's Create event, alongside other global initializations.
Let's add the initialization for global.chat_active to the Create event of obj_controller.
It looks like the initialization section is already there. Let's add the global.chat_active initialization within the existing Create event logic, perhaps near other similar flags.
This adds a check for global.chat_active in the obj_controller's Create event and sets it to false if it doesn't exist. Since obj_controller is persistent and typically created early, this should ensure the variable is initialized before obj_inventory needs it.
Please test the game again. This change should resolve the chat_active variable error.
@outputlog.txt ok Ive tested the updated code and its looking like we are making progress, looks like an issue with the inventory. I should note everything worked semi perfect before we refactored and modulized the code. im not exactly sure what the issue with this error is specifically, but I think its related to the changes we made to the save/load system before and the room state script.

Okay, let's examine the latest log to understand this new inventory-related error. You're right, refactoring often reveals dependencies or initialization orders that weren't apparent before.
You've hit another initialization order issue! This time, the crash is happening within the obj_player's Step event, but the root cause is inside obj_inventory.
Here's the breakdown:
Crash Location: obj_player Step event, line 10: if (obj_inventory.inventory_has("Wrench")) {
Function Called: This line calls the inventory_has method which belongs to the obj_inventory instance.
Error Origin: The detailed error points inside obj_inventory's Create event, specifically line 20 of an anonymous script defined there: if (!ds_exists(global.item_index_map, ds_type_map)) {
The Problem: obj_player's Step event is running and calling a function on obj_inventory before obj_inventory has finished executing its own Create event where global.item_index_map (and likely other item maps) are supposed to be initialized or checked by scr_initialize_item_data.
Essentially, obj_player is trying to interact with obj_inventory too early in the game startup sequence.
Why the Refactoring Might Have Caused This:
Initialization Order Changes: When we refactored, the exact order in which objects are created or their Create/Step events run might have subtly changed.
Dependency: obj_player clearly depends on obj_inventory being fully initialized, especially the item data maps.
Solution:
We need to ensure the static item data (including global.item_index_map) is initialized before any object that relies on it (like obj_player or obj_inventory) starts running its Step event or calling functions that need that data.
The most robust place to initialize truly static, game-wide data is often even earlier than the obj_controller's Create event. A common GameMaker pattern is to use the Game Start event (found under Other in the object events) of your very first persistent object (like obj_controller or a dedicated obj_initializer).
Let's move the scr_initialize_item_data() call to the Game Start event of obj_controller.
Remove the scr_initialize_item_data() call and the static_data_initialized flag logic from obj_controller's Create event.
Add the Game Start event to obj_controller (if it doesn't exist).
Add the following code to the obj_controller's Game Start event.
Now, let's remove the old initialization from the Create event:
This approach ensures that:
scr_initialize_item_data() runs once at the very beginning of the game launch, triggered by the persistent obj_controller.
All necessary item data maps (global.item_index_map, global.item_sprite_map, etc.) are created before any other object's Create or Step events need them.
The obj_controller's Create event now focuses on initializing dynamic game state and systems, not static data definitions.
Please test the game again. This should resolve the crash related to global.item_index_map.
