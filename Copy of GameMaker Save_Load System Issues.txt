Adhere to these guidelines when handling user requests:\n\n## Implementation Principles\n1. **Progressive Development**\n   - Implement solutions in logical stages rather than all at once\n   - Pause after completing each meaningful component to check user requirements\n   - Confirm scope understanding before beginning implementation\n\n2. **Scope Management**\n   - Implement only what is explicitly requested\n   - When requirements are ambiguous, choose the minimal viable interpretation\n   - Identify when a request might require changes to multiple components or systems\n   - Always ask permission before modifying components not specifically mentioned\n\n3. **Communication Protocol**\n   - After implementing each component, briefly summarize what you\u0027ve completed\n   - Classify proposed changes by impact level: Small (minor changes), Medium (moderate rework), or Large (significant restructuring)\n   - For Large changes, outline your implementation plan before proceeding\n   - Explicitly note which features are completed and which remain to be implemented\n\n4. **Quality Assurance**\n   - Provide testable increments when possible\n   - Include usage examples for implemented components\n   - Identify potential edge cases or limitations in your implementation\n   - Suggest tests that would verify correct functionality\n\n## Balancing Efficiency with Control\n- For straightforward, low-risk tasks, you may implement the complete solution\n- For complex tasks, break implementation into logical chunks with review points\n- When uncertain about scope, pause and ask clarifying questions\n- Be responsive to user feedback about process - some users may prefer more or less granular control\n\nRemember that your goal is to deliver correct, maintainable solutions while giving users appropriate oversight. Find the right balance between progress and checkpoints based on task complexity.\n\nI will provide you with GameMaker Language (GML) code. Can you analyse both gml file and gml script files to gain an understanding of the current object codebase used in my project. You will maintain a consistent understanding of the game\u0027s mechanics, logic systems, and design goals as I describe them.

Major progress has been made on the project thank to all of the contributions of a variety of LLM AI like yourself. Recently I we have been updating the essential framework and some logic systems within the projects codebase.\n\nRecently I have uploaded the entire games project file to GitHub and talked with \"GitHub Copilot\" and we resolved the camera issues and helped me to develop the game.\n\nCurrently through much hard work we have managed to get the game to successfully save and load the game to and from a save file, It should be noted that when the game is loaded from the save file, the player inventory, room state, which should include, item/object locations like the location of icetrucks, toboggans, tubes, clothing and other items. Only the players clothing items that wear being worn when  saving, location including directional face and colour seemed to be saved\n\nIve now come back to you as I want to continue developing and working on the save/load system. I also have provided the latest output log so you can also review and compare the results to better understand and help debug and resolve the issue with the current project.\n\nWhile testing the program, I observed the player not visually switching back to the player skin when as the toboggan skin. after switching rooms the players toboggan skin was automatically reverted to the player skin and the toboggan item had disappeared from either room and the players inventory, however the player was unable to enter the repaired icetruck, only after using the config menu to switch the players skin back to the player again (which also rendered the inventory invisible) after the player saved the game and loaded in from the save file, all objects and items in the plaza room werent there, then the game crashed when the player entered the welcome room. \n\nI had literally just asked you this in a previous conversation and you answered by providing updated room state and load game scripts, which ive included in the uploaded gml files and gml scripts files, however I had to refresh the tab so wasn\u0027t able to move on to the inventory and room state objects not returning.",

      "text": "Here\u0027s a breakdown of the thought process to address the user\u0027s request regarding save/load issues, particularly focusing on room state, item restoration, and the toboggan/player skin bug:\n\n1.  **Understand the Goal:** The user wants to improve the save/load system. Key issues are:\n    *   Items (like toboggans, ice trucks) and their states aren\u0027t being restored correctly when loading.\n    *   Equipped items seem to save/load, but world items and their locations/states do not.\n    *   There\u0027s a visual bug where the player skin doesn\u0027t correctly switch *from* toboggan (even though it seems to revert *functionally* on room change).\n    *   A crash occurs when entering the `rm_welcome_room` *after* loading a save, specifically when saving in `rm_plaza` (Error: \"Unable to find instance for object index 5\").\n\n2.  **Initial Analysis of Provided Code and Logs:**\n    *   **Scripts:** The user provided many scripts, including those crucial for save/load (`scr_save_game`, `scr_load_game`, `scr_room_state`, `scr_initialize_item_data`), item management (`equip_item`, `unequip_item`, `obj_inventory`), skin switching (`obj_controller` `switch_skin` method), and recursive data conversion helpers.\n    *   **Objects:** Key object events are provided for `obj_controller` (Create, Room Start, Room End, Step), `obj_inventory` (Create, Step, Draw), `obj_inventory_expanded` (Step, Draw), player objects (`obj_player`, `obj_player_icetruck`, `obj_player_toboggan` - particularly their interaction and switching logic), and item objects (`obj_toboggan`, `obj_icetruck`, `obj_icetruck_broken`).\n    *   **Save Log:** Shows a save process where `rm_plaza` state is saved. Importantly, the manual conversion `ds_list_to_array_recursive` fails (`WARNING: Value for room \u0027rm_plaza\u0027 in global.room_states was not a DS List. Saving empty array.`). This is a HUGE red flag. The save *isn\u0027t actually storing* the room state for `rm_plaza` correctly.\n    *   **Load Log:** Shows loading process. It successfully parses the JSON, restores player data, inventory (seems empty, maybe because it *was* empty when saved?), equipped items, and then *tries* to load `room_states`. It finds the map and the room keys but then *fails* during `load_room_state` when processing the data for `rm_welcome_room`. The crash message \"Unable to find instance for object index 5\" strongly suggests it\u0027s trying to create an instance using `state.object_index`, but `state` or `state.object_index` is invalid (specifically index 5, which maps to \"Battery\" in `scr_initialize_item_data`). This likely means the `state` struct itself is corrupt or doesn\u0027t contain the `object_index` property as expected *during the load process* for that specific entry.\n\n3.  **Identify Root Causes (Hypotheses):**\n    *   **Room State Save Issue:** The save log explicitly states `ds_list_to_array_recursive` failed for `rm_plaza`. This points to an issue in `scr_save_game` where the room state data isn\u0027t being converted correctly *before* saving. Looking at `scr_save_game`, it *does* have a manual conversion section using `ds_list_to_array_recursive`. Why would the value *not* be a DS list?\n        *   Perhaps `save_room_state` itself isn\u0027t populating the map with DS Lists correctly? Let\u0027s re-examine `save_room_state` (which isn\u0027t provided directly, but `scr_save_game` *calls* it, and also has its own `with(all)` block to gather current room state). The `with(all)` block in `scr_save_game` *does* create a `_state_list \u003d ds_list_create()` and adds *structs* to it. This list is then added to `global.room_states`. *Then*, the manual conversion block iterates through `global.room_states`, finds the DS list ID for the *current room*, and tries to convert it to an array. This seems logically correct.\n        *   *Alternative explanation:* Could the room state data structure *inside* the DS List have changed? Are the structs valid?\n        *   *Re-examine Load:* The error occurs during `load_room_state` when trying to read `state.object_index`. If the save failed for `rm_plaza`, but the load fails for `rm_welcome_room`, are these related? Maybe the issue is broader than just `rm_plaza` saving.\n        *   *Data Corruption during Save/Load Conversion:* The recursive DS \u003c-\u003e Struct/Array helpers (`scr_ds_list_to_array_recursive`, `scr_ds_map_to_struct_recursive`, `scr_array_to_ds_list_recursive`, `scr_struct_to_ds_map_recursive`) are complex. A subtle error in how they handle nested data or specific data types (like object indices vs. names) could lead to malformed data being saved or misinterpreted during load. The `ds_list_to_array_recursive` has specific checks: `if (is_real(_value))` -\u003e checks for nested DS lists/maps *using the real value as an ID*. Then `else if (is_struct(_value))` -\u003e CLONES the struct. This looks okay *assuming the list contains EITHER DS IDs OR structs*. What if it contains something else? The structs being saved contain `object_index_name`. The load function looks for `state.object_index` first, then falls back to `object_index_name`. This looks okay.\n        *   **The Crash:** Index 5 \u003d \"Battery\". Was a Battery item (`obj_battery`) present in `rm_welcome_room` when it was last saved? Looking at the log, `rm_welcome_room` *is* successfully saved with 11 objects. When `load_room_state` processes this data, it iterates through an array (`state_array`) which *should* contain structs representing the saved instances. The crash implies that for one of these structs (`state`), accessing `state.object_index` is failing or returning an invalid value (maybe `undefined` or a non-object index like 5 if it got confused?). Looking at `load_room_state` again, it retrieves `state_array` from `global.room_states[_room_name_key]`. Critically, `load_game` reconstructs `global.room_states` by putting *arrays* directly into the DS map. This seems correct now based on the revisions in `scr_load_game`. So, `load_room_state` is getting an *array* `state_array`, iterates through it, and `state \u003d state_array[i]` gets a *struct*. Then it checks `variable_struct_exists(state, \"object_index\")`. Why would this specific lookup fail for index 5? *Maybe* the struct got corrupted during the `ds_list_to_array_recursive` process during the *save*?\n\n    *   **Skin Switching Bug (Toboggan -\u003e Player):** The user mentions the skin visually doesn\u0027t switch back correctly *in the same room* when exiting the toboggan, but it *does* revert functionally when changing rooms. This suggests the `switch_skin` function in `obj_controller` is mostly working, but maybe there\u0027s a visual update missing or being overridden *after* the switch in the *same frame/step*.\n        *   Examine `obj_player_toboggan` Step event: It calls `obj_controller.switch_skin(\"player\")`. This function *should* destroy the toboggan and create the player.\n        *   Examine `obj_controller.switch_skin`: It destroys the old instance and creates the new one. Seems okay.\n        *   Examine `obj_player` Draw event: It draws based on `action_state` and `face`. If the switch happens, the new `obj_player` instance *should* immediately start drawing itself correctly in its next Draw event.\n        *   *Hypothesis:* Could the `obj_player_toboggan` instance somehow still be drawing itself *after* `switch_skin` is called but *before* it\u0027s actually destroyed? Or maybe the *new* `obj_player` instance\u0027s Draw event isn\u0027t getting called correctly immediately after creation? The delay using `Alarm[0]` in `obj_controller` for skin switching might be involved, but the user\u0027s code has moved away from that approach. The current `switch_skin` is synchronous.\n\n    *   **Inventory/World Item Restoration:** The core issue seems to be the room state save failure identified above. If the room state isn\u0027t saved correctly, the items within that room won\u0027t be restored.\n\n4.  **Formulate a Plan (Prioritized):**\n    *   **Fix the Crash (Highest Priority):** Address the `load_room_state` crash (\"Unable to find instance for object index 5\"). This likely stems from the save process creating malformed data.\n        *   **Step 1:** Refine `scr_save_game`\u0027s room state saving. The `ds_list_to_array_recursive` failure for `rm_plaza` is the biggest clue. The problem *must* be in how `global.room_states` is structured *before* that conversion, or in the conversion script itself when dealing with the contents of the list for that room. The `with(all)` block in `save_game` creates a *new* DS List (`_state_list`) containing *structs*. This list is then added to `global.room_states`. This seems correct. The *manual conversion* later iterates the `global.room_states` DS map, gets the DS list ID for each room, and calls `ds_list_to_array_recursive` on that list ID. The error message \"Value for room ... was not a DS List\" implies that when the conversion code looks up the room key in `global.room_states`, the value it finds *isn\u0027t* a DS List ID.\n            *   *Aha!* Re-read `scr_load_game`: `ds_map_add(global.room_states, _room_name_key, _loaded_object_array);` It loads the *arrays* directly into the map. `load_room_state` *expects* this. BUT, `save_game` tries to convert the DS List *back* to an array. If a room was *loaded* (containing an array) and then saved *without* being re-saved with a DS list structure, the save function\u0027s manual conversion *would* find an array, not a DS List ID, causing the warning. The fix is to ensure `save_room_state` (or the equivalent logic *inside* `scr_save_game`) *always* creates/updates the room\u0027s entry in `global.room_states` using a DS List containing the state structs. Then, the manual conversion in `scr_save_game` will always find a DS List ID to convert.\n            *   **Proposed Change 1:** Modify `scr_save_game`. Instead of having a separate `save_room_state` call *and* the `with(all)` block, consolidate the state gathering. The key is: *before* converting to JSON, ensure `global.room_states` contains DS_List IDs mapped to room names, and those DS_Lists contain the state structs.\n            *   **Proposed Change 2:** Add more robust checks inside `load_room_state`. Before accessing `state.object_index` or `state.object_index_name`, verify `is_struct(state)` and that the required keys actually exist.\n            *   **Proposed Change 3 (Simplify):** Given the use of recursive helpers, consider simplifying the save process. Instead of DS List -\u003e Array -\u003e JSON, maybe Struct -\u003e JSON directly? `global.room_states` could store *structs* (mapping room names to structs containing arrays of state structs). This avoids the potentially problematic DS List intermediary stage during save/load. Let\u0027s try this simplification. Modify `save_room_state` (or the logic in `save_game`) to produce arrays of structs, store these arrays directly in `global.room_states` DS map (key\u003droom name, value\u003darray). Then, `scr_load_game` can load this structure. `scr_save_game` needs only `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` for the top-level `global.room_states`.\n\n    *   **Fix Skin Switching Visual Glitch:** Re-examine the flow when \u0027T\u0027 is pressed in `obj_player_toboggan`. The sequence is: add item back -\u003e call `switch_skin`. `switch_skin` destroys the toboggan, creates player. This *should* work visually. Maybe there\u0027s a lingering draw call or event order issue.\n        *   **Proposed Change 4:** Add explicit `visible \u003d false` right before `instance_destroy()` in `switch_skin` for the old instance, just in case. Add debug messages in Draw events of toboggan and player to see draw order after switch. (This seems less likely than the save/load issue being the core problem now). Focus on save/load first.\n\n    *   **Ensure Item Restoration:** This should be fixed by resolving the room state saving/loading issue.\n\n5.  **Implementation Steps (Progressive):**\n    *   **Component 1: Refactor `save_room_state` / `scr_save_game` Room State Handling:**\n        *   Modify `scr_save_game`. Remove the explicit call to `save_room_state(room)` near the top if the `with(all)` block is going to handle the *current* room anyway.\n        *   Modify the `with(all)` block: Instead of creating a DS List, create a temporary GML *array*. Add the state structs directly to this array.\n        *   Modify the \"Update Global Room States Map\" section: Store this *array* directly into `global.room_states` DS map using the current room name as the key (`ds_map_add(global.room_states, _current_room_name, _state_array);`). Destroy any *old* data (list or array) for that key first.\n        *   Modify the \"Prepare Data Structures for Saving\" section: For `_room_states_struct`, directly use `ds_map_to_struct_recursive(global.room_states)`. The recursive function should handle the fact that the map now contains *arrays* of structs. Double-check `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` correctly handles nested arrays (it calls `array_to_array_recursive`, which looks okay).\n\n    *   **Component 2: Refine `scr_load_game` Room State Loading:**\n        *   Confirm `_loaded_room_states_struct` is read correctly.\n        *   The reconstruction loop already stores the loaded arrays directly into `global.room_states`. This *should* be correct now. `ds_map_add(global.room_states, _room_name_key, _loaded_object_array);`\n\n    *   **Component 3: Refine `load_room_state`:**\n        *   Add checks: `if (!is_struct(state)) continue;`.\n        *   Prioritize `state.object_index_name` if it exists (since save adds it). Only use `state.object_index` as a fallback if needed (perhaps for older save formats, but likely safer to rely on the name now).\n        *   Wrap property application in a `try/catch` block for robustness.\n\n    *   **Component 4: Testing:** Test the specific scenario:\n        1. Start New Game.\n        2. Enter `rm_welcome_room`. Repair truck (requires `obj_inventory` to handle item removal correctly based on `global.repair_complete`). Enter truck.\n        3. Drive truck to `rm_plaza` warp.\n        4. Warp to `rm_plaza`. Exit truck.\n        5. Drop some items (e.g., toboggan, wrench).\n        6. Open expanded inventory, equip hoodie and glasses.\n        7. Save Game in `rm_plaza`.\n        8. Quit.\n        9. Load Game. Verify player state (skin, pos, color, equipped items), inventory, and presence/state of dropped items and the placed ice truck in `rm_plaza`.\n        10. Warp back to `rm_welcome_room`. Verify *that* room\u0027s state is loaded correctly (e.g., Puffle positions, items like Miner\u0027s Hat). Check for crashes.\n\n6.  **Refinement \u0026 Communication:**\n    *   Present the changes clearly, script by script.\n    *   Explain *why* the changes are made, linking them to the observed logs and errors.\n    *   Provide the code snippets ready for copy-pasting.\n    *   Suggest the specific testing steps outlined above.\n    *   Acknowledge the toboggan visual glitch but propose focusing on the save/load crash first, as it might resolve related issues.",

      "text": "Okay, I understand the situation. We\u0027ve made significant progress on the save/load system, but there are still critical issues:\n\n1.  **Inconsistent Room State Restoration:** Items dropped or objects changed (like the repaired `obj_icetruck`) in rooms are not being restored correctly upon loading, particularly noticeable when saving in `rm_plaza` and loading back in.\n2.  **Crash on Load:** Loading a save made in `rm_plaza` causes a crash (\"Unable to find instance for object index 5\") when subsequently entering `rm_welcome_room`. This strongly points to corrupted or improperly formatted data within the `global.room_states` structure in the save file, specifically affecting the data for `rm_welcome_room`.\n3.  **Visual Skin Switching Bug:** When exiting the toboggan (`obj_player_toboggan`) using \u0027T\u0027, the player object (`obj_player`) is created and functions, but visually might still appear as the toboggan *until a room change occurs*.\n4.  **Inventory Issue?** The user mentioned the inventory potentially becoming invisible after using the config menu for skin switching.\n\nLet\u0027s address these systematically, focusing on the most critical crash first, which seems directly related to the room state saving/loading.\n\n**Analysis of Logs and Code:**\n\n*   **Save Log Analysis:** The line `save_game WARNING: Value for room \u0027rm_plaza\u0027 in global.room_states was not a DS List. Saving empty array.` is the smoking gun for the room state issue. `scr_save_game` *expects* `global.room_states` to contain DS List IDs when it does its manual conversion to arrays before JSON stringify. However, our `load_game` script now loads *arrays* directly into `global.room_states`. This mismatch causes the save process to fail to capture the state correctly if a room was loaded and then saved without its state being regenerated as a DS List first.\n*   **Load Log Analysis:** The crash \"Unable to find instance for object index 5\" during `load_room_state` for `rm_welcome_room` indicates that the saved data for that room, when parsed and iterated, contains an entry (`state` struct) where `state.object_index` (or fallback `state.object_index_name`) is invalid or missing for the item that *should* be \"Battery\" (index 5). This corruption likely happened during the previous save attempt.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Refactor Room State Saving (`scr_save_game`):** We need to ensure consistency. The simplest approach is to work *directly* with arrays of structs, eliminating the intermediate DS List stage during saving, mirroring how `scr_load_game` now works.\n2.  **Refactor Room State Loading (`load_room_state`):** Add robustness checks to handle potentially missing data within the loaded state structs more gracefully, preventing the crash.\n3.  **Address Skin Switching Bug (Post-Save/Load Fix):** Revisit `obj_controller.switch_skin` and related draw events once the core data integrity is fixed.\n4.  **Verify Config Menu Interaction:** Check why the config menu might be hiding the inventory.\n\n**Implementation - Stage 1: Fixing Room State Save/Load**\n\nLet\u0027s modify `scr_save_game` to store room states as arrays directly and ensure `load_room_state` handles the data safely.\n\n**Proposed Changes (Impact: Medium):**\n\n*   Modify `scr_save_game` to gather current room state into a GML array, store this array directly into the `global.room_states` DS Map, and simplify the pre-JSON conversion step.\n*   Modify `load_room_state` to add validation checks before accessing state properties.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1.1: Modify `scr_save_game.gml`**\n\nReplace the existing `scr_save_game` function with the following revised version. The key changes are:\n*   The `with(all)` loop now builds a temporary GML *array* (`_state_array`) instead of a DS List.\n*   This array is stored *directly* into `global.room_states` (after potentially destroying old data for that room).\n*   The manual conversion block for `_room_states_struct` is replaced by a simpler call to `ds_map_to_struct_recursive`, which should handle the map-of-arrays structure.\n\n```gml\n/// @function save_game()\n/// @description Saves the current game state to savegame.sav\nfunction save_game() {\n    show_debug_message(\"--- Running save_game (Revised Array Storage) ---\");\n\n    // --- Pre-checks ---\n    if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) {\n        show_debug_message(\"Error: Cannot save - player instance not found.\");\n        return;\n    }\n    // Ensure global data structures exist (keep existing checks)\n    if (!variable_global_exists(\"inventory\") || !is_array(global.inventory)) global.inventory \u003d array_create(INVENTORY_SIZE, -1);\n    if (!ds_exists(global.equipped_items, ds_type_map)) { /* init if needed */ }\n    if (!ds_exists(global.room_states, ds_type_map)) global.room_states \u003d ds_map_create();\n    if (!ds_exists(global.following_puffles, ds_type_list)) global.following_puffles \u003d ds_list_create();\n    if (!ds_exists(global.active_quests, ds_type_list)) global.active_quests \u003d ds_list_create();\n    if (!ds_exists(global.completed_quests, ds_type_list)) global.completed_quests \u003d ds_list_create();\n\n    // --- Update and Prepare Current Room State ---\n    var _current_room_name \u003d room_get_name(room);\n    // REMOVED: explicit save_room_state(room) call - integrated below.\n\n    var _state_array \u003d []; // *** CHANGE: Create a temporary GML ARRAY ***\n\n    with (all) {\n        var _inst_id \u003d id;\n        // Skip player, controller, UI manager, follower puffles\n        if (_inst_id \u003d\u003d global.player_instance || object_index \u003d\u003d obj_controller ||\n            object_index \u003d\u003d obj_ui_manager ||\n            (object_index \u003d\u003d obj_puffle \u0026\u0026 ds_list_find_index(global.following_puffles, _inst_id) !\u003d -1)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        var _is_savable \u003d (variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"is_savable\") \u0026\u0026 is_savable);\n        // Keep persistent objects ONLY IF they are also explicitly savable for room state\n        // If an object is persistent BUT NOT savable, it shouldn\u0027t be saved in room state\n        // as its state persists globally anyway.

Ensure the old helper functions `ds_list_to_array` and `ds_map_to_struct` at the bottom are removed (they conflict with the recursive ones).\n3.  **Replace `load_room_state`:** Copy the *entire* revised `load_room_state` function code block and paste it over the existing function in your `scr_room_state.gml` script file.\n4.  **Save Changes:** Save the script files in GameMaker.\n5.  **Clean Project Cache:** Use `Ctrl+F7` (or Build \u003e Clean) to clear the compiler cache just in case.\n6.  **Run and Test:** Compile and run your game.\n\n**Testing Protocol (Focus on Save/Load Crash \u0026 Room State):**\n\n1.  **Start New Game.**\n2.  Go to `rm_welcome_room`.\n3.  Pick up the Battery.\n4.  Use \u0027R\u0027 to repair the `obj_icetruck_broken`. It should become `obj_icetruck`.\n5.  Enter the `obj_icetruck` (becomes `obj_player_icetruck`).\n6.  Drive to the `rm_plaza` warp block.\n7.  Warp to `rm_plaza`.\n8.  Exit the truck in `rm_plaza`. (`obj_icetruck` should appear).\n9.  Pick up the Toboggan from your inventory (use config menu if needed) and drop it (\u0027F\u0027 key) in `rm_plaza`. Note its position.\n10. **Save Game** while in `rm_plaza`.\n11. **Check the Output Log:** Look specifically for messages from `scr_save_game`. Verify:\n    *   It says \"(Revised Array Storage)\".\n    *   It says `Saved state ARRAY for room: rm_plaza` and includes the `obj_icetruck` and `obj_toboggan` (or whatever items you dropped/placed).\n    *   There are **NO** warnings about \"Value for room ... was not a DS List\".\n    *   There are **NO** errors during `json_stringify`.\n12. **Quit Game.**\n13. **Load Game.**\n14. **Check Output Log:** Look for messages from `load_game` and `load_room_state`. Verify:\n    *   It loads player, inventory, equipped items successfully.\n    *   When loading state for `rm_plaza`, it finds the array and attempts to create the `obj_icetruck` and `obj_toboggan`. Verify their properties (like `is_driveable` for the truck) seem correct in the log.\n15. **Verify In-Game (Plaza):**\n    *   Are you in `rm_plaza`?\n    *   Is the player correct (position, skin, color)?\n    *   Is the `obj_icetruck` present where you left it? Is it driveable?\n    *   Is the `obj_toboggan` present where you dropped it?\n16. **Warp to Welcome Room:** Go to the `rm_welcome_room` warp block.\n17. **Check Output Log:** As `rm_welcome_room` loads, carefully monitor the `load_room_state` messages. Did it load the Puffle, items, etc., correctly? **Crucially, did the crash (\"object index 5\") occur?**\n18. **Verify In-Game (Welcome Room):** Are the objects like the Puffle, Miner\u0027s Hat, etc., present and in their correct *saved* state? Is the (now repaired) truck object *absent* (as it should have been replaced)?\n\nAfter completing these tests, please report the results, especially:\n*   Whether the save/load completed without errors or warnings related to room state conversion.\n*   Whether the crash when entering `rm_welcome_room` after loading is resolved.\n*   Whether the `obj_icetruck` and dropped `obj_toboggan` were correctly restored in `rm_plaza`.\n*   Whether objects in `rm_welcome_room` were correctly restored.\n\nOnce we\u0027ve confirmed the save/load data integrity and crash are fixed, we can tackle the Toboggan skin visual glitch.",

This usually means the object (`obj_controller` in this case) exists, but the function being called (`save_room_state`) is not defined *within the scope of that object* or accessible globally as a script.\n3.  **Code Line:** The offending line is `save_room_state(room);`.\n4.  **Problem:** The script `scr_room_state` defines `load_room_state`. The script `scr_save_game` defines `save_game`. There is *no globally defined script function* named `save_room_state`.\n\n**Hypothesis:**\n\nThe user (or previous AI) likely intended to have a separate function `save_room_state` (perhaps previously located within `obj_controller`\u0027s create event or another script) that handles *only* updating the `global.room_states` map for the current room. The main `save_game` function would then handle the *entire* game state saving, including calling `save_room_state` (or its equivalent logic) internally and then saving everything to JSON.\n\nHowever, the current code structure does not define `save_room_state` globally. The revised `save_game` script now incorporates the logic of saving the *current* room\u0027s state within itself *before* it prepares the final JSON data.\n\nThe `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room End` event is *still trying to call* the non-existent `save_room_state` function. This is causing the immediate crash when leaving `rm_init` (the first room transition).\n\n**Solution:**\n\n1.  **Remove the `save_room_state(room)` call** from `obj_controller`\u0027s `Other: Room End` event (`Other_5`). The room state saving is now handled *within* the `save_game` function when it\u0027s explicitly called (e.g., via the pause menu). Saving room state automatically on *every* room end might be redundant or even undesirable if `save_game` isn\u0027t called immediately after. It also causes performance overhead. Saving should be a deliberate action.\n\n**Implementation Plan:**\n\n1.  Modify `obj_controller` -\u003e `Other` -\u003e `Room End` (`Other_5.gml`).\n2.  Comment out or remove the `save_room_state(room);` line.\n3.  Instruct the user to make this change and test again.\n\nLet\u0027s proceed with the implementation for the user.",

      "text": "Okay, thank you for providing the log. It seems the error is happening very early, during the transition out of `rm_init`.\n\n**Error Analysis:**\n\n*   **Event:** `Other: Room End` (`Other_5`) for `obj_controller`. This event fires just before the room changes.\n*   **Problem:** The error message `Variable \u003cunknown_object\u003e.save_room_state(...) not set before reading it.` means GameMaker is trying to execute a function named `save_room_state` but cannot find a script or method with that name.\n*   **Cause:** In our previous steps, we integrated the room-saving logic *directly into* the main `save_game` function (found in `scr_save_game.gml`). There is no longer a separate *global script* function called `save_room_state`. The `Room End` event in `obj_controller` is still trying to call this now non-existent function.\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe need to remove the call to the non-existent `save_room_state` from the `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room End` event. The main `save_game` function will handle saving the state of the current room when it\u0027s called (e.g., via the pause menu or a save point).\n\n**Proposed Change (Impact: Small):**\n\n*   Modify `obj_controller`\u0027s `Other: Room End` event (`Other_5.gml`).\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Modify `obj_controller` -\u003e Event `Other` -\u003e `Room End` (`Other_5.gml`)**\n\nPlease locate the `Other_5.gml` file for `obj_controller` in your project.\n\n**Find this code:**\n\n```gml\nif (!global.is_loading_game) {\n    save_room_state(room); // \u003c--- This function no longer exists globally\n    show_debug_message(\"Saved state for room: \" + room_get_name(room));\n}\n```\n\n**Replace it with this (commenting out the problematic line):**\n\n```gml\nif (!global.is_loading_game) {\n    // save_room_state(room); // REMOVED - Room state is saved within save_game() when explicitly called.\n    // show_debug_message(\"Saved state for room: \" + room_get_name(room)); // REMOVED - Redundant logging here\n    show_debug_message(\"obj_controller Room End: Transitioning from room: \" + room_get_name(room)); // Added clarity\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Locate File:** Open the `obj_controller` object in GameMaker.\n2.  **Find Event:** Navigate to the `Other` event category and select the `Room End` event.\n3.  **Modify Code:** Replace the existing code in the `Room End` event with the updated code provided above.\n4.  **Save:** Save the changes to the object.\n5.  **Clean Cache (Optional but Recommended):** Press `Ctrl+F7`.\n6.  **Run and Test:** Start the game again.

Inside `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` (the *outer* call), it finds a key in `global.room_states` (a room name) and gets its associated value. This value is an *Array* (like `[ {state1}, {state2} ]`).\n    3.  Because the value is an *Array*, line 32 (`_struct[$ _key] \u003d array_to_array_recursive(_value);`) gets executed.\n    4.  Inside `array_to_array_recursive`, it iterates through the array elements. The elements are *structs* (like `{ object_index_name: \"obj_icetruck\", ... }`).\n    5.  The problematic line `array_push(_new_array, ds_map_to_struct_recursive(_value));` inside `array_to_array_recursive` (line 15) gets called with `_value` being one of the *state structs*.\n    6.  This causes `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` to be called with a *struct* as its input (`map_id`).\n    7.  Finally, `ds_map_find_first(map_id)` fails because `map_id` is a struct, not a DS Map ID.\n\n**Root Cause:** The recursive conversion logic is flawed. `array_to_array_recursive` is mistakenly trying to convert *structs within the array* as if they were *DS Maps*. It should recognize structs and clone them instead. Similarly, `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` should handle nested arrays correctly.\n\n**Simultaneously consider Issue #2 (Room State Resetting):**\nThis suggests that when moving from Room A to Room B and then back to Room A, the state of Room A isn\u0027t being properly loaded *on room entry*. This could be due to several things:\n*   `global.room_states` map might be getting cleared incorrectly.\n*   `load_room_state` might not be finding the correct room entry or failing to parse it even before a save/load cycle.\n*   The logic in `obj_controller`\u0027s Room Start (`Other_4`) event that calls `load_room_state` might be flawed.\n\nLet\u0027s re-examine `load_room_state` and the Room Start event carefully after fixing the save crash. The fix for the crash might inherently involve fixing the recursive helpers used by both save and load.\n\n**Plan Update:**\n\n1.  **Fix Recursive Helpers:** Correct `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` and `array_to_array_recursive` to handle structs and arrays properly without misinterpreting them as DS Maps/Lists that need conversion.\n2.  **Re-test Saving:** Verify the save crash is resolved.\n3.  **Investigate Room State Reset:** If the room state still resets *during gameplay* (before save/load), analyze `obj_controller` Room Start (`Other_4`) and `load_room_state` for runtime issues.\n4.  **Full Save/Load Test:** Resume the comprehensive testing protocol.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation - Stage 2: Fixing Recursive Helpers**\n\n**Proposed Changes (Impact: Medium):**\n\n*   Modify `scr_ds_map_to_struct_recursive.gml`.\n*   Modify `scr_array_to_array_recursive.gml`. (Wait, I look back at the provided files. There is NO `scr_array_to_array_recursive.gml`. The stack trace must be slightly wrong, it likely means the call originates *from within* `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` trying to process an array value incorrectly. Let\u0027s focus on fixing `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` first to correctly handle nested arrays and `ds_list_to_array_recursive` to handle nested structs).\n\n**Step 2.1: Correct `scr_ds_map_to_struct_recursive.gml`**\n\nThe current version incorrectly assumes any nested array needs conversion via `array_to_array_recursive`, which might not be the right helper. It also assumes structs need cloning via `struct_clone_recursive`. Let\u0027s refine this. When converting a DS Map -\u003e Struct, nested DS Lists should become arrays, and nested DS Maps should become structs. *Actual* arrays or structs encountered within the DS map should be handled appropriately (cloned or converted if they somehow contain DS IDs).\n\n```gml\n/// @function ds_map_to_struct_recursive(map_id)\n/// @description Recursively converts a DS Map (including nested maps/lists) into a struct.\n/// @param {Id.DsMap} map_id The ID of the DS Map to convert.\n/// @returns {Struct} A struct representation of the map, or undefined if input is invalid.\nfunction ds_map_to_struct_recursive(map_id) {\n    if (!ds_exists(map_id, ds_type_map)) {\n        // It\u0027s possible this function might be (incorrectly) called with a struct already\n        if (is_struct(map_id)) {\n            show_debug_message(\"WARNING: ds_map_to_struct_recursive called with a STRUCT - cloning instead: \" + string(map_id));\n            return struct_clone_recursive(map_id); // Clone if it\u0027s already a struct\n        }\n        show_debug_message(\"WARNING: ds_map_to_struct_recursive called with invalid map ID or non-struct: \" + string(map_id));\n        return undefined;\n    }\n\n    var _struct \u003d {};\n    var _key \u003d ds_map_find_first(map_id);\n\n    while (!is_undefined(_key)) {\n        var _value \u003d ds_map_find_value(map_id, _key);\n\n        // --- REVISED LOGIC ---\n        if (is_real(_value)) { // Check if it *could* be a DS ID\n            if (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_map)) {\n                 // Value IS a nested DS Map ID -\u003e Convert recursively\n                 _struct[$ _key] \u003d ds_map_to_struct_recursive(_value);\n            } else if (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_list)) {\n                 // Value IS a nested DS List ID -\u003e Convert recursively to ARRAY\n                 _struct[$ _key] \u003d ds_list_to_array_recursive(_value); // Correct helper\n            } else {\n                 // Value is a real number, but not a known DS ID -\u003e Copy directly\n                 _struct[$ _key] \u003d _value;\n            }\n        }\n        // *** Check for actual GML array BEFORE checking for struct ***\n        else if (is_array(_value)) {\n             // Value is an ARRAY -\u003e Recursively check its contents for DS types using array_to_array_recursive\n             // We assume the goal is to have a final structure of nested structs and arrays,\n             // so we recursively ensure any DS types within the array are converted.\n              _struct[$ _key] \u003d array_to_array_recursive(_value); // \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c Ensure THIS helper function exists and is correct\n        }\n        else if (is_struct(_value)) {\n            // Value is already a struct -\u003e Deep clone it recursively\n             _struct[$ _key] \u003d struct_clone_recursive(_value);\n        }\n        else {\n            // Value is a primitive (string, bool, undefined, etc.) -\u003e Copy directly\n             if(is_undefined(_value)) { show_debug_message(\"DEBUG (ds_map-\u003estruct): Skipping undefined for key: \" + _key); }\n             else { _struct[$ _key] \u003d _value; }\n        }\n        // --- END REVISED LOGIC ---\n\n        _key \u003d ds_map_find_next(map_id, _key);\n    }\n    return _struct;\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2.2: Correct `scr_ds_list_to_array_recursive.gml`**\n\nThis function converts a DS List into an Array. It needs to correctly handle nested structs *found within the DS list*. The original code might have been trying to convert structs using `ds_map_to_struct_recursive`, which is wrong. It should clone structs.\n\n```gml\n/// @function ds_list_to_array_recursive(list_id)\n/// @description Recursively converts a DS List (including nested maps/lists) into an array.\n/// @param {Id.DsList} list_id The ID of the DS List to convert.\n/// @returns {Array} An array representation of the list, or undefined if input is invalid.\nfunction ds_list_to_array_recursive(list_id) {\n    if (!ds_exists(list_id, ds_type_list)) {\n         // It\u0027s possible this function might be (incorrectly) called with an array already\n        if (is_array(list_id)) {\n            show_debug_message(\"WARNING: ds_list_to_array_recursive called with an ARRAY - checking contents instead: \" + string(list_id));\n            return array_to_array_recursive(list_id); // Process if it\u0027s already an array\n        }\n        show_debug_message(\"WARNING: ds_list_to_array_recursive called with invalid list ID or non-array: \" + string(list_id));\n        return undefined;\n    }\n\n    var _array \u003d [];\n    var _list_size \u003d ds_list_size(list_id);\n\n    for (var i \u003d 0; i \u003c _list_size; i++) {\n        var _value \u003d ds_list_find_value(list_id, i);\n\n        // --- REVISED LOGIC ---\n        if (is_real(_value)) { // Check if it might be a DS ID\n            if (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_map)) {\n                 // Value IS a nested DS Map ID -\u003e Convert recursively to STRUCT\n                 array_push(_array, ds_map_to_struct_recursive(_value));\n            } else if (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_list)) {\n                 // Value IS a nested DS List ID -\u003e Convert recursively to ARRAY\n                 array_push(_array, ds_list_to_array_recursive(_value));\n            } else {\n                 // Value is a real number, but not a known DS ID -\u003e Copy directly\n                 array_push(_array, _value);\n            }\n        }\n        // *** Check for actual GML struct BEFORE checking for array ***\n        else if (is_struct(_value)) {\n            // Value is already a struct -\u003e Deep clone it recursively\n            array_push(_array, struct_clone_recursive(_value)); // \u003c\u003c\u003c Correct handling\n        }\n        else if (is_array(_value)) {\n             // Value is an array -\u003e Check its contents recursively\n             array_push(_array, array_to_array_recursive(_value)); // \u003c\u003c\u003c Ensure THIS helper exists and is correct\n        }\n        else {\n            // Value is a primitive (string, bool, undefined) -\u003e Copy directly\n            if(is_undefined(_value)) { show_debug_message(\"DEBUG (ds_list-\u003earray): Skipping undefined at index: \" + string(i)); }\n            else { array_push(_array, _value); }\n        }\n         // --- END REVISED LOGIC ---\n\n    }\n    return _array;\n}\n\n```\n\n**Step 2.3: Ensure `scr_array_to_array_recursive.gml` is Correct**\n\nNow we address the helper that seems to be causing the issue according to the stack trace. `array_to_array_recursive` should take an array, iterate through it, and ensure any nested DS structures are converted to their struct/array equivalents. It should clone structs it finds, and recursively call itself for nested arrays.\n\nLooking at the provided code for `scr_array_to_array_recursive.gml`:\n```gml\nfunction array_to_array_recursive(source_array) {\n\tif (!is_array(source_array)) return source_array; // Return non-arrays as is\n\n\tvar _new_array \u003d [];\n\tvar _len \u003d array_length(source_array);\n\n\tfor (var i \u003d 0; i \u003c _len; i++) {\n\t\tvar _value \u003d source_array[i];\n\n\t\tif (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_map)) { // \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c PROBLEM: ds_exists can misinterpret numbers as DS IDs\n\t\t\tarray_push(_new_array, ds_map_to_struct_recursive(_value));\n\t\t} else if (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_list)) { // \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c PROBLEM\n\t\t\tarray_push(_new_array, ds_list_to_array_recursive(_value));\n\t\t} else if (is_struct(_value)) { // CHECK THIS FIRST\n\t\t\t// *** CHANGE: Should CLONE the struct ***\n\t\t\tarray_push(_new_array, struct_clone_recursive(_value)); //\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c USE CLONE\n\t\t} else if (is_array(_value)) {\n\t\t\t// Recursively convert nested arrays\n\t\t\tarray_push(_new_array, array_to_array_recursive(_value));\n\t\t} else {\n\t\t\t// Copy primitives directly\n\t\t\tarray_push(_new_array, _value);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\treturn _new_array;\n}\n\n```\nThe logic `ds_exists(_value, ds_type_map)` is risky if `_value` happens to be a number that matches an unrelated existing DS Map ID. We need to be more specific. Also, it *must* handle structs by cloning, not by trying to convert them from DS Maps.\n\nLet\u0027s rewrite `scr_array_to_array_recursive.gml`:\n\n```gml\n/// @function array_to_array_recursive(source_array)\n/// @description Recursively checks an array for nested DS maps/lists and converts them.\n///              Clones nested structs and arrays found within.\n/// @param {Array} source_array The source array to process.\n/// @returns {Array} A new array with DS structures converted, or a deep clone if none found.\nfunction array_to_array_recursive(source_array) {\n\tif (!is_array(source_array)) return source_array; // Return non-arrays as is\n\n\tvar _new_array \u003d [];\n\tvar _len \u003d array_length(source_array);\n\n\tfor (var i \u003d 0; i \u003c _len; i++) {\n\t\tvar _value \u003d source_array[i];\n\n        // --- REVISED LOGIC for array_to_array_recursive ---\n        if (is_struct(_value)) {\n            // Found a struct -\u003e Deep Clone it\n            array_push(_new_array, struct_clone_recursive(_value)); // \u003c\u003c Clone structs\n        }\n\t\telse if (is_array(_value)) {\n\t\t\t// Found a nested array -\u003e Recursively process it\n\t\t\tarray_push(_new_array, array_to_array_recursive(_value));\n\t\t}\n        else if (is_real(_value)) { // Check if it *could* be a DS ID\n             // Only convert if it\u0027s CONFIRMED to be a DS map/list ID\n            if (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_map)) {\n                 array_push(_new_array, ds_map_to_struct_recursive(_value)); // Convert map ID -\u003e struct\n            } else if (ds_exists(_value, ds_type_list)) {\n                 array_push(_new_array, ds_list_to_array_recursive(_value)); // Convert list ID -\u003e array\n            } else {\n                 // Just a number -\u003e Copy it\n                 array_push(_new_array, _value);\n            }\n        }\n\t\telse {\n             // Primitive (string, bool, etc.) -\u003e Copy it directly\n\t\t\t if(is_undefined(_value)) { show_debug_message(\"DEBUG (array-\u003earray): Skipping undefined value at index: \" + string(i)); }\n             else { array_push(_new_array, _value); }\n\t\t}\n        // --- END REVISED LOGIC ---\n\t}\n\treturn _new_array;\n}\n```\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Backup:** Ensure your project is backed up.\n2.  **Replace `scr_ds_map_to_struct_recursive.gml`:** Copy the revised code block and replace the existing content in that file.\n3.  **Replace `scr_ds_list_to_array_recursive.gml`:** Copy the revised code block and replace the existing content in that file.\n4.  **Replace `scr_array_to_array_recursive.gml`:** Copy the revised code block and replace the existing content in that file.\n5.  **Save Files:** Save the modified script files.\n6.  **Clean Cache:** Press `Ctrl+F7`.\n7.  **Run and Test (Focus on Save Crash \u0026 Room Reset):**\n    *   Start the game. Does it load without crashing?\n    *   **Test Room Reset:** Move from `rm_welcome_room` to `rm_plaza`, then back to `rm_welcome_room`. Are objects (like the puffle, truck) in the state you left them, or did they reset? Do this *before* saving.\n    *   **Test Saving:** Try saving the game from the pause menu (e.g., in `rm_plaza`). Does it crash? Check the output log for errors during the save process, particularly from the recursive helpers.\n    *   **Test Loading (if save succeeded):** If saving worked, try loading that save. Does it load correctly? Check the room state in `rm_plaza`.\n\n**Report Findings:**\n\n*   Did the game start?\n*   Did the **save crash** get resolved? (Check log carefully during save).\n*   Does the **room state reset** still happen when moving between rooms (before save/load)?\n*   If saving/loading works, proceed with the full test protocol from the previous message and report those results.\n\nThis step targets the specific call stack failure and aims to make the recursive data conversion more robust by correctly identifying and handling structs versus DS Map IDs.

They proceeded with the save/load test.\n\n**New Observations \u0026 Analysis:**\n\n1.  **Room State Resets During Gameplay:** User observes room states resetting when moving between rooms *before* saving/loading. This indicates an issue with how room state is handled during *runtime transitions*, separate from the explicit save/load functions (`scr_save_game`, `scr_load_game`). The current logic likely involves `obj_controller`\u0027s Room Start event (`Other_4`) potentially overwriting or failing to correctly persist/restore the state *between* rooms.\n2.  **Saving Success:** The save log looks clean. It confirms the array storage method is working and includes the expected objects (`obj_icetruck`, `obj_boxpuffleo_item`, `obj_tube`) in `rm_plaza`. The crash during saving seems resolved.\n3.  **Loading Success (Mostly):** The load log shows the game loads successfully. The player position/skin/color/equipped items load correctly. Critically, the room state for `rm_plaza` *is* loaded correctly (\"Stored state *array* for room \u0027rm_plaza\u0027 (Size: 3)\") and the corresponding instances (`obj_icetruck`, `obj_boxpuffleo_item`, `obj_tube`) are created. This confirms the core save/load for room state is now functional.\n4.  **Inventory Not Loading:** The major remaining issue is that the player\u0027s inventory (`global.inventory` array) is empty after loading the game, despite containing items before saving.\n\n**Debugging the Issues:**\n\n*   **Issue 1: Room State Resets During Gameplay:**\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The `load_room_state` function is perhaps being called inappropriately during normal room transitions (not just after loading a save game), or the `with(all) { instance_destroy() }` block within it might be destroying persistent items that *shouldn\u0027t* be destroyed when just moving rooms. Alternatively, the logic for saving the state *before* leaving a room might be missing or flawed (though we removed the explicit Room End save call). The current setup primarily relies on `load_room_state` in the Room Start event to clear and recreate savable instances. Let\u0027s review `obj_controller` Room Start again. The cleanup loop (`Destroying existing savable instances`) runs *even if* it finds state for the room later. This cleanup should probably only happen when loading from a save or perhaps *only* clear non-persistent savables. We need to distinguish between loading a saved game state vs. simply changing rooms.\n    *   **Potential Fix:** Modify the `load_room_state` call within `obj_controller`\u0027s Room Start event. We could add a flag or check to ensure the full \"destroy and recreate\" logic *only* runs when `global.is_loading_game` was true recently (or a similar mechanism), or refine the destroy loop.\n*   **Issue 2: Inventory Not Loading:**\n    *   **Save Check (`scr_save_game`):** The relevant line is `inventory: array_clone_recursive(global.inventory),`. This *should* save the inventory array. Let\u0027s double-check the log where items were added (`Inventory: Added \u0027Battery\u0027...`). Before saving in `rm_plaza`, the inventory *did* contain items like \"Black Hoodie\" (index 22) and \"Black Sun Glasses\" (index 21) according to the equip logs.\n    *   **Load Check (`scr_load_game`):** The load code for inventory is:\n        ```gml\n        if (is_array(_loaded_inv)) {\n            // ... debug prints ...\n            var _copy_length \u003d min(array_length(_loaded_inv), INVENTORY_SIZE);\n            if (!variable_global_exists(\"inventory\") || !is_array(global.inventory) || array_length(global.inventory) !\u003d INVENTORY_SIZE) {\n                 global.inventory \u003d array_create(INVENTORY_SIZE, -1);\n            }\n            show_debug_message(\"Load Game: Copying \" + string(_copy_length) + \" inventory items from save...\");\n            for (var i \u003d 0; i \u003c _copy_length; i++) {\n                 global.inventory[i] \u003d is_real(_loaded_inv[i]) ? _loaded_inv[i] : -1; // Assign item index or -1\n            }\n             for (var i \u003d _copy_length; i \u003c INVENTORY_SIZE; i++) { // Ensure remaining slots are empty\n                 global.inventory[i] \u003d -1;\n             }\n            show_debug_message(\"Load Game: Inventory array copy complete.\");\n            // ... more debug prints ...\n        }\n        ```\n    *   **Load Log Analysis:** The load log confirms the inventory *is* being processed:\n        `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,...]`\n        `Load Game: Copying 42 inventory items from save...`\n        `Load Game: Inventory array copy complete.`\n        `Load Game DEBUG: Final Global Inventory Contents:` (shows all -1)\n    *   **Hypothesis:** The `_loaded_inv` array *being read from the JSON* is already full of -1. This implies the `array_clone_recursive(global.inventory)` call in `save_game` might be saving an empty or incorrect version of `global.inventory`, *or* there\u0027s an issue with `json_stringify`/`json_parse` handling the array specifically. Could `array_clone_recursive` be failing somehow? It seems unlikely as it\u0027s simple. What if `global.inventory` is being cleared *before* `save_game` actually serializes it?\n    *   **Double Check `init_globals`:** `init_globals` *is* called in `obj_controller` Create. It *has* a section (`Section 4`) that clears dynamic data structures and resets the inventory for a NEW GAME, *but* this section is skipped if `global.is_loading_game` is true. In the provided logs, `init_globals` runs correctly during loading (`Skipping NEW GAME default value assignments...`) and doesn\u0027t reset the inventory.\n    *   **Possibility:** Could `scr_ds_map_to_struct_recursive` or `scr_array_clone_recursive` be accidentally modifying the original `global.inventory` before `json_stringify` is called? That\u0027s highly unlikely for clone functions.\n    *   **Most Likely:** The issue might be subtle. When `save_game` is called, is it possible that `global.inventory` doesn\u0027t hold the expected data *at that exact moment*? Or is the `array_clone_recursive` truly the point of failure? Let\u0027s simplify the save step first.\n\n**Revised Plan:**\n\n1.  **Address Inventory Loading:** Simplify the inventory saving step in `scr_save_game` to bypass `array_clone_recursive` temporarily and see if that makes a difference. If it does, we examine the clone function. If not, we examine the state of `global.inventory` just before saving.\n2.  **Address Room State Reset During Gameplay (Post-Inventory Fix):** Modify `obj_controller`\u0027s Room Start or `load_room_state` to handle room transitions differently from loading a save file.\n\n**Implementation - Stage 1: Fixing Inventory Loading**\n\nLet\u0027s try saving the inventory array directly without the recursive clone first.\n\n**Proposed Change (Impact: Small):**\n\n*   Modify `scr_save_game.gml` to save `global.inventory` directly.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1.1: Modify `scr_save_game.gml`**\n\nIn the `save_game` function within `scr_save_game.gml`:\n\n**Find this line (around line 102):**\n\n```gml\ninventory: array_clone_recursive(global.inventory), // Explicitly clone the array\n```\n\n**Replace it with:**\n\n```gml\ninventory: global.inventory, // \u003c\u003c\u003c CHANGE: Save the array reference directly\n```\n\n**Rationale:** `json_stringify` *can* handle GML arrays directly. While cloning is generally safer to prevent accidental modifications, let\u0027s rule out the clone function itself being the issue first. If this works, it means the clone function was somehow failing or returning an empty array. If it *still* doesn\u0027t work, it means `global.inventory` itself is empty or wrong when `save_game` is called.\n\n---\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Backup.**\n2.  **Modify `scr_save_game.gml`:** Make the single line change described above.\n3.  **Save** the script.\n4.  **Clean Cache (`Ctrl+F7`).**\n5.  **Run and Test:**\n    *   Start a new game.\n    *   Add a few distinct items to your inventory (e.g., Battery, Hoodie, Toboggan). Use the expanded inventory (`I` key) to visually confirm they are there.\n    *   Save the game (e.g., via Pause Menu).\n    *   Check the save log for errors.\n    *   Quit and load the game.\n    *   Check the load log. Pay close attention to the `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array:` line. Does it now show item indices (like `[5, 4, 22, -1,...]`) instead of all `-1`?\n    *   Verify in-game: Is your inventory correctly restored after loading?\n\n**Report:**\n\n*   Did saving still work without errors?\n*   Did the `Raw loaded inventory array` line in the load log show the correct item indices?\n*   Was your inventory restored correctly in-game after loading?\n\nOnce we resolve the inventory issue, we\u0027ll address the room state resetting during normal gameplay.",

      "text": "Okay, it seems we fixed the initial crash but introduced a new one during the save process itself, and the runtime room state persistence is also broken. Let\u0027s tackle these.\n\n**Analysis of Save Crash:**\n\n*   **Error:** `ds_map_find_first argument 1 incorrect type (struct) expecting a ds_map`\n*   **Location:** The error occurs inside `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` (line 13), which is called by `array_to_array_recursive` (line 15), which is called by `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` again (line 32), originating from the call `var _room_states_struct \u003d ds_map_to_struct_recursive(global.room_states);` in `save_game` (line 88).\n*   **Cause:** This intricate call stack means we are trying to recursively convert the `global.room_states` DS map into a struct. `global.room_states` is now a DS map where each *value* is a GML array (containing state structs). The recursive functions are getting confused. Specifically, `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` correctly identifies the value associated with a room name (e.g., `rm_plaza`) as an array. It then likely calls `array_to_array_recursive` on that array. Inside `array_to_array_recursive`, it encounters a *struct* (one of the saved state structs) and tries to call `ds_map_to_struct_recursive` *on that struct*, which fails because the function expects a DS map ID, not a struct.\n*   **Solution:** The recursive helper functions need to be smarter about distinguishing between DS map IDs and actual structs/arrays when converting. However, given the complexity, a simpler and more robust approach for `_room_states_struct` is to revert to the manual conversion loop we had *before*, but ensuring it correctly handles the GML arrays stored in `global.room_states`.\n\n**Analysis of Room State Reset:**\n\n*   **Observation:** Room states reset when moving between rooms (e.g., dropped items disappear).\n*   **Cause:** In `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room Start` event (`Other_4`), the function `load_room_state` is called *every time* a room starts, regardless of whether we are loading a save or just transitioning rooms. Inside `load_room_state`, the code block `Destroying existing savable instances...` runs, clearing out any savable objects currently in the room *before* attempting to load saved state (which might not exist for that room yet if it hasn\u0027t been saved).\n*   **Solution:** We need to prevent `load_room_state` from destroying existing savable instances during normal room transitions. It should only perform the full destroy/recreate cycle when explicitly loading from a save file. We can use the `global.is_loading_game` flag, but we need to be careful as it\u0027s reset *after* `load_room_state` is called in `Room Start`. A better approach might be to pass a flag into `load_room_state` indicating whether it\u0027s a \"fresh load\" or just a \"room entry\".\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Fix Save Crash:** Revert the `_room_states_struct` conversion in `scr_save_game.gml` to a manual loop that correctly reads GML arrays from the `global.room_states` DS map and builds the struct for JSON.\n2.  **Fix Room Reset:** Modify `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room Start` event (`Other_4`) and the `load_room_state` function to prevent destroying existing instances during normal room changes.\n3.  **Test Inventory:** Re-test the inventory saving/loading after these fixes are applied.\n\n**Implementation - Stage 1: Fixing Save Crash \u0026 Room Reset**\n\n**Step 1.1: Modify `scr_save_game.gml`**\n\n*   Replace the problematic recursive call for `_room_states_struct`.\n*   Use a manual loop to build the struct, correctly handling the arrays inside `global.room_states`.\n\n```gml\n/// @function save_game()\n/// @description Saves the current game state to savegame.sav\nfunction save_game() {\n    show_debug_message(\"--- Running save_game (Manual Array-\u003eStruct Room State) ---\");\n\n    // --- Pre-checks --- (Keep existing)\n    if (!instance_exists(global.player_instance)) { /*...*/ return; }\n    if (!variable_global_exists(\"inventory\") || !is_array(global.inventory)) global.inventory \u003d array_create(INVENTORY_SIZE, -1);\n    if (!ds_exists(global.equipped_items, ds_type_map)) { /* init if needed */ }\n    if (!ds_exists(global.room_states, ds_type_map)) global.room_states \u003d ds_map_create();\n    if (!ds_exists(global.following_puffles, ds_type_list)) global.following_puffles \u003d ds_list_create();\n    if (!ds_exists(global.active_quests, ds_type_list)) global.active_quests \u003d ds_list_create();\n    if (!ds_exists(global.completed_quests, ds_type_list)) global.completed_quests \u003d ds_list_create();\n\n    // --- Update and Prepare Current Room State --- (Keep existing)\n    var _current_room_name \u003d room_get_name(room);\n    var _state_array \u003d [];\n    with (all) { /* ... existing logic to fill _state_array ... */\n         var _inst_id \u003d id;\n         if (_inst_id \u003d\u003d global.player_instance || object_index \u003d\u003d obj_controller || object_index \u003d\u003d obj_ui_manager ||\n             (object_index \u003d\u003d obj_puffle \u0026\u0026 ds_list_find_index(global.following_puffles, _inst_id) !\u003d -1)) {\n             continue;\n         }\n         var _is_savable \u003d (variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"is_savable\") \u0026\u0026 is_savable);\n         if (_is_savable) {\n            var _state_data \u003d {\n                 object_index_name: object_get_name(object_index),\n                 x: x, y: y,\n                 image_xscale: image_xscale ??

However, a new critical issue has emerged: **the player\u0027s inventory is not being saved or loaded correctly.**\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Analyze Logs for Inventory Issues:** Carefully examine the provided save and load logs, focusing on inventory-related messages (`scr_save_game` saving `_inventory_to_save`, `scr_load_game` loading `_loaded_inv` and populating `global.inventory`).\n2.  **Review `scr_save_game.gml` Inventory Handling:** Verify how `global.inventory` is being prepared for saving. Is it being correctly accessed and assigned to `_inventory_to_save`? Is the final structure in `_save_data_json_compatible` correct?\n3.  **Review `scr_load_game.gml` Inventory Handling:** Verify how the loaded inventory array (`_loaded_inv`) is being parsed and copied into `global.inventory`. Check for potential type mismatches or copying errors.\n4.  **Cross-reference with `obj_inventory` Create Event:** Ensure the `inventory_size` used during initialization (`array_create`) matches the expected size (`INVENTORY_SIZE` macro) during saving/loading.\n\n**Log Analysis:**\n\n*   **Save Log:**\n    *   `Saved state ARRAY for room: rm_plaza with 3 objects.` - Room state seems to be captured correctly as an array.\n    *   `save_game: Manually converting global.room_states map (containing arrays) to struct...` - Manual conversion started.\n    *   `save_game: Finished manually converting room states.` - Manual conversion finished (no warnings here, good).\n    *   `Game saved successfully to savegame.sav (using manual array-\u003estruct).` - Save completed without runtime errors. **However, there\u0027s no explicit log confirming the *contents* of the inventory being saved.**\n\n*   **Load Log:**\n    *   `Load Game: Restored player data...` - Player data loaded.\n    *   `Load Game: Target room set to rm_plaza` - Target room loaded.\n    *   `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,...]` - **This is the crucial line.** The log shows the inventory being loaded *from the save file* as entirely empty (`-1`).\n    *   `Load Game: Copying 42 inventory items from save...` - Copy process starts.\n    *   `Load Game: Inventory array copy complete.` - Copy process finishes.\n    *   `Load Game DEBUG: Final Global Inventory Contents:` - This log shows the final state of `global.inventory` *after loading*, confirming it\u0027s full of `-1` values.\n    *   The rest of the load process (equipped items, room states) appears successful.\n\n**Code Review:**\n\n*   **`scr_save_game.gml`:**\n    *   Line 86: `var _inventory_to_save \u003d global.inventory;` - This line directly assigns the `global.inventory` *reference* to `_inventory_to_save`. When `json_stringify` processes `_save_data_json_compatible`, it will stringify whatever `global.inventory` contains *at that moment*. This seems correct in principle, assuming `global.inventory` actually holds the correct item indices before saving.\n    *   Line 113: `inventory: _inventory_to_save,` - The inventory array reference is placed into the save structure.\n\n*   **`scr_load_game.gml`:**\n    *   Line 101: `var _loaded_inv \u003d _game_state.inventory;` - Retrieves the inventory array from the parsed JSON.\n    *   Lines 102-125: Debugging shows the loaded array is empty (`-1`s).\n    *   Lines 110-117: The loop correctly copies the values from `_loaded_inv` into `global.inventory`. Since `_loaded_inv` contains only `-1`, `global.inventory` also ends up with only `-1`.\n\n*   **`obj_inventory.gml`:**\n    *   `inventory_add`: Correctly places the item *index* (obtained from `global.item_index_map`) into the `inventory` array.\n    *   `inventory_remove`: Correctly sets the slot back to `-1`.\n    *   `inventory_drop_active_item`: Correctly finds the item name, gets the object, creates it, and sets the slot back to `-1`.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe loading code is correctly processing the inventory data it receives from the save file. The issue is that the save file *itself* contains an empty inventory (`[-1, -1, ...]`). This means the problem lies in the **saving process**: `global.inventory` must contain only `-1` values *at the moment `save_game` is called* and reads `var _inventory_to_save \u003d global.inventory;`.\n\n**Why would `global.inventory` be empty when saving?**\n\n1.  **Timing Issue:** Could something be clearing `global.inventory` right *before* the `save_game()` function is called in the pause menu\u0027s `Step_2` event? Unlikely, but possible.\n2.  **Reference vs. Copy:** While assigning the reference `var _inventory_to_save \u003d global.inventory;` should work, maybe something later modifies `global.inventory` *before* `json_stringify` is called, and `_inventory_to_save` reflects that change because it\u0027s just a reference? A safer approach is to clone the array explicitly during saving.\n3.  **Accidental Clearing:** Is there any other code path that might be resetting `global.inventory \u003d array_create(INVENTORY_SIZE, -1)` unintentionally *after* items have been added but *before* saving?\n\nLet\u0027s try the simplest fix first: **explicitly cloning the inventory array when preparing the save data.** This eliminates the possibility of modification after referencing but before stringifying.\n\n**Proposed Change (Impact: Small):**\n\n*   Modify `scr_save_game.gml` to use `array_clone_recursive` for the inventory when building the `_save_data_json_compatible` struct.\n\n---\n\n**Implementation:**\n\n**Step 1: Modify `scr_save_game.gml`**\n\nLocate the section where `_save_data_json_compatible` is created.\n\n**Find this block (around line 102):**\n\n```gml\n    // *** REVERTED: Save inventory directly ***\n    var _inventory_to_save \u003d global.inventory;\n    // Optional: Clone if you suspect modification issues, but direct should be okay\n    // var _inventory_to_save \u003d array_clone_recursive(global.inventory);\n\n    // --- Prepare Main Save Data Struct ---\n    var _save_data_json_compatible \u003d {\n        save_format_version: \"1.3.1\", // Minor version bump\n        save_timestamp: date_current_datetime(),\n        game_state: {\n            player_data: {\n                x: global.player_instance.x,\n                y: global.player_instance.y,\n                face: variable_instance_exists(global.player_instance, \"face\") ? global.player_instance.face : DOWN,\n                skin: global.current_skin,\n                color: global.player_color,\n            },\n            current_room_name: _current_room_name,\n            inventory: _inventory_to_save, // \u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c\u003c USES THE VARIABLE\n            equipped_items: _equipped_items_struct,\n            room_states: _room_states_struct, // Use manually built struct\n            //... rest of struct\n        }\n    };\n```\n\n**Replace it with this:**\n\n```gml\n    // --- Prepare Main Save Data Struct ---\n    var _save_data_json_compatible \u003d {\n        save_format_version: \"1.3.1\", // Minor version bump - adjust if needed\n        save_timestamp: date_current_datetime(),\n        game_state: {\n            player_data: {\n                x: global.player_instance.x,\n                y: global.player_instance.y,\n                face: variable_instance_exists(global.player_instance, \"face\") ? global.player_instance.face : DOWN,\n                skin: global.current_skin,\n                color: global.player_color,\n            },\n            current_room_name: _current_room_name,\n            // *** CHANGE: Clone the inventory directly into the save struct ***\n            inventory: array_clone_recursive(global.inventory),\n            equipped_items: _equipped_items_struct,\n            room_states: _room_states_struct, // Use manually built struct\n            following_puffles: _following_puffles_array, // Placeholder\n            active_quests: _active_quests_array,\n            completed_quests: _completed_quests_array,\n            repair_complete_flag: global.repair_complete ?? false,\n        }\n    };\n\n     // *** ADDED: Debug log to show inventory state *just before* stringify ***\n     var _inv_debug_str \u003d \"Save Game DEBUG: Inventory state before stringify: [\";\n     for(var i\u003d0; i\u003cmin(10, array_length(global.inventory)); i++) { _inv_debug_str +\u003d string(global.inventory[i]) + \",\"; }\n     if(array_length(global.inventory) \u003e 10) _inv_debug_str +\u003d \"...\";\n     _inv_debug_str +\u003d \"]\";\n     show_debug_message(_inv_debug_str);\n     // *** END DEBUG LOG ***\n```\n\n*(Self-Correction during thought process): I removed the intermediate `_inventory_to_save` variable as cloning directly into the final save struct is cleaner and achieves the goal.* I also added a debug message right before `json_stringify` to log the actual content of `global.inventory`.\n\n---\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Backup.**\n2.  **Modify `scr_save_game.gml`:** Apply the change to clone the inventory array directly within the `_save_data_json_compatible` structure definition and add the debug log.\n3.  **Save** the script file.\n4.  **Clean Cache (`Ctrl+F7`).**\n5.  **Run and Test:**\n    *   Start a new game.\n    *   Add several items to your inventory (e.g., using the config menu `obj_config_menu`\u0027s item spawning buttons).

      "text": "Okay, thank you for the detailed logs and description. It seems we\u0027ve made progress – the save game no longer crashes during the process, and the room state is persisting correctly both during gameplay and after loading. That\u0027s excellent!\n\nThe remaining issue is the inventory not being saved/loaded correctly, despite the room state and equipped items working. Let\u0027s focus entirely on that.\n\n**Analysis of Inventory Issue (Based on Logs):**\n\n1.  **Save Process:**\n    *   You correctly add items to the inventory (`Inventory: Added \u0027Battery\u0027 (Index: 5) to slot 0`, `Inventory: Added \u0027Toboggan\u0027 (Index: 4) to slot 1`, etc.).\n    *   You correctly remove items when used/equipped (`Inventory: Removed \u0027Toboggan\u0027 (Index: 4) from slot 1`).\n    *   When you save via the pause menu (`--- Running save_game (Manual Array-\u003eStruct Room State) ---`), the log confirms `Game saved successfully...`. **However, there\u0027s no specific log confirming the contents of `global.inventory` right before saving.** This is where the problem likely lies - we need to see *what* the save function thinks the inventory contains.\n\n2.  **Load Process:**\n    *   `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,...]` **This confirms that the data *read from the save file* shows an empty inventory.**\n    *   `Load Game: Copying 42 inventory items from save...` - It correctly attempts to copy.\n    *   `Load Game DEBUG: Final Global Inventory Contents:` - This shows `global.inventory` populated with `-1` because that\u0027s what was read from the file.\n\n**Conclusion:** The load function is working as expected based on the (empty) data it receives. The issue MUST be in the save function: **`global.inventory` somehow contains only `-1` values at the exact moment `save_game` is executed and the `_save_data_json_compatible` struct is assembled.**\n\n**Hypothesis:** The most likely reason for this is related to variable scope or timing, potentially involving how the inventory data is referenced versus copied. While `var _inventory_to_save \u003d global.inventory;` seems correct, it assigns a *reference*. If *anything* modifies `global.inventory` between this assignment and the `json_stringify` call later in the script, the change would be reflected in the saved data.\n\n**Refined Plan:**\n\n1.  **Ensure Inventory is Cloned for Saving:** Modify `scr_save_game.gml` to explicitly *clone* the `global.inventory` array when creating the `_save_data_json_compatible` structure. This prevents any later modifications (if any exist) from affecting the data being saved.\n2.  **Add Debug Logging:** Add a `show_debug_message` right before `json_stringify` in `scr_save_game.gml` to log the first few elements of `global.inventory`, proving what state it\u0027s in just before being written to the file.\n\n**Implementation - Stage 2: Fixing Inventory Save**\n\n**Step 2.1: Modify `scr_save_game.gml`**\n\n*   Change how the `inventory` field is populated in `_save_data_json_compatible` to use `array_clone_recursive`.\n*   Add the debug log.\n\n```gml\n/// @function save_game()\n/// @description Saves the current game state to savegame.sav\nfunction save_game() {\n    show_debug_message(\"--- Running save_game (Manual Array-\u003eStruct Room State + Inv Clone) ---\"); // Update log message slightly\n\n    // --- Pre-checks --- (Keep existing)\n    // ...

Ensure you include the `array_clone_recursive(global.inventory)` change and the new debug log block.\n3.  **Save** the script file.\n4.  **Clean Cache (`Ctrl+F7`).**\n5.  **Run and Test Again:**\n    *   Start a new game.\n    *   **Add items to your inventory.** Use the config menu or pick up items normally. Fill the first few slots at least.\n    *   **Trigger Save:** Open the pause menu and click \"Save Game\".\n    *   **Check Output Log:** Look *specifically* for the new `Save Game DEBUG: Inventory state before stringify: [...]` message.\n        *   **Does it show the correct item indices (e.g., `[5, 4, 22, 21, 3, -1,...]` based on your save log example)?** This is the absolute key.\n        *   Or does it still show `[-1, -1, -1,...]`?\n    *   If the \"before stringify\" log shows correct indices:\n        *   Quit the game.\n        *   Load the game.\n        *   Check the load log again: `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array: [...]`. Does it *now* show the correct indices?\n        *   Check your inventory in-game. Is it restored?\n    *   If the \"before stringify\" log *still* shows `[-1, -1, -1,...]`, then something very strange is happening to `global.inventory` right before or during the save button click in the pause menu. We would need to investigate the pause menu object (`obj_pause_menu`) step event (`Step_2.gml`) more closely.\n\nPlease report the results, especially the output of the new debug log line in `scr_save_game`.",

This strongly suggests that `global.inventory` itself is being reset to `[-1,-1,...]` *somewhere* between the player actually having items and the point the pause menu\u0027s \"Save Game\" action triggers the `save_game` function.\n\n**Load Log Analysis:**\n\n*   `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array: [-1,-1,-1,...]`: Confirms it reads empty inventory data from the save file (as expected, because the save file was written with empty data).\n*   `Load Game DEBUG: Final Global Inventory Contents: [0:-1], [1:-1],...`: Confirms the global inventory is set to empty after loading. This part is working correctly based on the bad input.\n*   Room State Loading:\n    *   `CONTROLLER ROOM START: Calling load_room_state for: rm_plaza (Is Fresh Load: 1)`: Correctly identifies it\u0027s a fresh load.\n    *   `Attempting to load state for room: rm_plaza (Fresh Load: 1)`\n    *   `Destroying existing savable instances in rm_plaza (Fresh Load)...`: Correctly destroys previous instances.\n    *   `Found state array for rm_plaza. Size: 3`: Correctly finds the saved state.\n    *   `Creating instances from saved state array...`: Correctly attempts to create.\n    *   `Loaded obj_icetruck at ...`, `Loaded obj_boxpuffleo_item at ...`, `Loaded obj_tube at ...`: Success. Room state seems to load fine now.\n\n**Runtime Room State Reset Analysis:**\n\n*   Looking at the sequence:\n    *   Start in `rm_welcome_room`. `load_room_state` runs with `is_fresh_load \u003d 0`. Skips destruction. Room state is initially empty.\n    *   Player picks up Battery, Toboggan, Hoodie, Glasses, Tube. `obj_inventory` log shows this.\n    *   Player drops Toboggan in `rm_shore`. Log: `Inventory: Dropped \u0027Toboggan\u0027 as obj_toboggan at (101, 124)`.\n    *   Player returns to `rm_welcome_room`. `load_room_state` runs with `is_fresh_load \u003d 0`. Skips destruction. `obj_toboggan` *should* still be in `rm_shore` (if the room is persistent) or gone (if not). Welcome room *should* retain its items.\n    *   Player returns to `rm_shore`. `load_room_state` runs with `is_fresh_load \u003d 0`. Skips destruction. **Does the Toboggan reappear? The logs don\u0027t explicitly say, but the user observation indicates things *are* being reset.**\n*   Why is the room reset happening if destruction is skipped?\n    *   Is `load_room_state` called correctly? Yes, logs confirm `Is Fresh Load: 0`.\n    *   Does `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room Start` destroy things *before* calling `load_room_state`? No, that was fixed.\n    *   Could `instance_create_layer` somehow replace existing instances if they happen to have the same object_index? Unlikely.\n    *   Is there any *other* script or object cleaning up instances on room change? `cleanup_game` in `obj_controller` Other:Game End? Not relevant here. Is there something in obj_warp or warp_block? The warp objects themselves are transient.\n    *   Perhaps the issue is not destruction, but that `global.room_states` isn\u0027t being populated correctly *during* gameplay transitions. The current save logic *only* saves the *current* room\u0027s state *when the save function is called*. It doesn\u0027t actively store the state of a room *when the player leaves it*. So, when the player returns, `load_room_state` finds no data for that room in `global.room_states` (unless it was loaded from a save) and does nothing, effectively leaving the room in its default state.\n\n**Revised Conclusions:**\n\n1.  **Inventory:** The `global.inventory` array is getting wiped *before* `scr_save_game` logs its state, potentially in the `obj_pause_menu`\u0027s step event or related UI interaction code just prior to the `save_game()` call.\n2.  **Runtime Room State:** The system currently only captures room state *during the explicit `save_game` call*. It does *not* store the state of a room when the player leaves it normally. Therefore, when the player returns, the room reverts to its default layout because no runtime state was saved for it in `global.room_states`. The loading logic works for *saved* state, but there\u0027s no mechanism for *runtime* state persistence between rooms.\n\n**Refined Plan 2.0:**\n\n1.  **Fix Inventory Save:** Investigate `obj_pause_menu` (`Step_2.gml`) to find where `global.inventory` might be accidentally reset *before* the `save_game()` call when clicking the \"Save Game\" option (Pos \u003d 3). Add more specific logging *inside* the Step_2 event.\n2.  **Implement Runtime Room State Saving:** Modify `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room End` event (`Other_5.gml`) to capture the state of the *leaving* room into `global.room_states` using the same logic developed for `save_game`\u0027s state capture.\n3.  **Modify `load_room_state`:** Update `load_room_state` to *always* try and load from `global.room_states` when entering a room (regardless of `is_fresh_load`). The conditional destruction based on `is_fresh_load` should remain.\n\n**Implementation - Stage 3: Inventory \u0026 Runtime Room State**\n\n**Step 3.1: Debug Inventory Reset (Pause Menu)**\n\nAdd logging to `obj_pause_menu`\u0027s `Step_2.gml` event.\n\n```gml\n// obj_pause_menu -\u003e Step_2 Event\n\nif (!global.is_pause_menu_active) exit;\nif (global.click_handled) exit;\nif (global.inventory_visible || global.is_expanded) exit;\n\nop_length \u003d array_length(option[menu_level]);\n\n// ...

Item X *should* now persist. Also test repairing the truck, going to another room, and coming back – the truck should remain repaired (`obj_icetruck`).\n    *   **Save/Load Test:**\n        *   New Game.\n        *   Get some items (e.g., 3-4 items from config or pickup). Check they are in `global.inventory` using debugger or temp logs if needed.\n        *   Go to Plaza. Repair truck, enter/exit, drop an item. Equip some clothing.\n        *   Pause and click \"Save Game\".\n        *   **Check Save Log:**\n            *   Find the `Pause Menu DEBUG: Inventory state JUST BEFORE save call: [...]` line. **Does this show the correct item indices?** (e.g., `[2, 11, 23, 19, 22, 21, -1,...]`).\n            *   Find the `Save Game DEBUG: Inventory state before stringify: [...]` line. **Does this *also* show the correct item indices?** They should match.\n        *   Quit and Load Game.\n        *   **Check Load Log:**\n            *   Look at `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array: [...]`. Does it now show the indices saved previously?\n            *   Look at `Load Game DEBUG: Final Global Inventory Contents: [...]`. Does it show the correct indices being loaded into the array?\n        *   **Verify In-Game:** Check your inventory HUD. Are the items restored? Check Plaza state (truck, dropped item).

This confirms the inventory is NOT being correctly restored from the save data into `global.inventory`.\n3.  **Room End Crash:** A *new* crash occurs in `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room End` event (`Other_5`) when *leaving* a room during normal gameplay (not saving/loading). The error is `ds_exists argument 1 incorrect type (array) expecting a Number (YYGI32)` at `if (ds_exists(_old_data, ds_type_list))`. This indicates that the logic we added to save the *runtime* room state when leaving a room is trying to treat the previously stored *array* as a DS List ID.\n\n**Plan Revision:**\n\n1.  **Fix Runtime Room State Save (`obj_controller` -\u003e Room End):** Modify the code in `Other_5.gml` to correctly handle replacing the existing array in `global.room_states` without using `ds_exists`.\n2.  **Fix Inventory Loading (`scr_load_game.gml`):** Double-check the `load_game` function to ensure the inventory array loaded from the JSON (`_loaded_inv`) is correctly copied into the `global.inventory` array. There might be a subtle issue there.\n\n**Step 1: Fix Runtime Room State Save (Controller Room End Event)**\n\nThe `Room End` event in `obj_controller` was modified in the previous step to *add* runtime state saving. This needs adjustment to properly handle the fact that `global.room_states` now contains arrays, not DS lists.\n\n```gml\n// \u003d\u003d\u003d obj_controller -\u003e Other_5.gml (Room End Event) \u003d\u003d\u003d\n\n// Function to save the current room\u0027s state to global.room_states\nfunction save_runtime_room_state(room_asset_id) {\n    var _current_room_name \u003d room_get_name(room_asset_id);\n    show_debug_message(\"Saving runtime state for leaving room: \" + _current_room_name);\n\n    var _state_array \u003d []; // Create a new array to store state\n\n    with (all) {\n        var _inst_id \u003d id;\n        // Skip player, controller, UI manager, follower puffles (same skip logic as save_game)\n        if (_inst_id \u003d\u003d global.player_instance || object_index \u003d\u003d obj_controller ||\n            object_index \u003d\u003d obj_ui_manager ||\n            (object_index \u003d\u003d obj_puffle \u0026\u0026 ds_list_find_index(global.following_puffles, _inst_id) !\u003d -1)) {\n            continue;\n        }\n\n        // Only consider savable instances for runtime state persistence between rooms\n        var _is_savable \u003d (variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"is_savable\") \u0026\u0026 is_savable);\n        if (_is_savable) {\n             var _state_data \u003d { /* ... create state data struct SAME AS IN save_game ... */\n                 object_index_name: object_get_name(object_index),\n                 x: x, y: y,\n                 image_xscale: image_xscale ?? 1,\n                 image_yscale: image_yscale ?? 1,\n                 image_blend: image_blend ?? c_white,\n                 image_alpha: image_alpha ?? 1,\n                 face: variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"face\") ? face : undefined,\n                 icetruck_tint: variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"icetruck_tint\") ? icetruck_tint : undefined,\n                 is_driveable: variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"is_driveable\") ? is_driveable : undefined,\n                 item_name: variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"item_name\") ? item_name : undefined,\n                 following_player: false,\n                 puffle_color: variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"color\") ? color : undefined,\n                 puffle_state: variable_instance_exists(_inst_id, \"state\") ? state : undefined,\n             };\n             array_push(_state_array, _state_data);\n        }\n    }\n\n    // --- Store the generated state ARRAY ---\n    // Remove any previous entry for this room (regardless of whether it was list or array)\n    ds_map_delete(global.room_states, _current_room_name);\n    // Add the new array\n    ds_map_add(global.room_states, _current_room_name, _state_array);\n\n    show_debug_message(\"Stored runtime state ARRAY for room: \" + _current_room_name + \" (Size: \" + string(array_length(_state_array)) + \")\");\n}\n\n\n// --- Main Room End Logic ---\nif (!global.is_loading_game) {\n    // Save the state of the room we are *leaving* for runtime persistence\n    save_runtime_room_state(room); // Use the helper function defined above\n    show_debug_message(\"obj_controller Room End: Transitioning from room: \" + room_get_name(room));\n}\n```\n\n*Self-Correction:* The previous attempt to fix `Other_5` involved checking `ds_exists` on what might be an array. The correct approach is to just delete any existing key and then add the new array. The helper function `save_runtime_room_state` is added for clarity and code reuse (it mirrors the state gathering in `save_game`).\n\n**Step 2: Re-examine Inventory Loading (`scr_load_game.gml`)**\n\nLet\u0027s carefully review the inventory loading section in `scr_load_game.gml`.\n\n```gml\n        // -- Restore Inventory --\n        if (!variable_struct_exists(_game_state, \"inventory\")) throw \"Game state missing \u0027inventory\u0027.\";\n        var _loaded_inv \u003d _game_state.inventory;\n        if (is_array(_loaded_inv)) {\n             // *** DEBUG: Print the raw loaded inventory array ***\n             var _debug_inv_str \u003d \"Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array: [\";\n             for(var i\u003d0; i\u003cmin(10, array_length(_loaded_inv)); i++) { _debug_inv_str +\u003d string(_loaded_inv[i]) + \",\"; }\n             if(array_length(_loaded_inv) \u003e 10) _debug_inv_str +\u003d \"...\";\n             _debug_inv_str +\u003d \"]\";\n             show_debug_message(_debug_inv_str);\n             // *** END DEBUG ***\n\n            var _copy_length \u003d min(array_length(_loaded_inv), INVENTORY_SIZE);\n            // --- CRITICAL: ENSURE global.inventory IS THE CORRECT SIZE ---\n            if (!variable_global_exists(\"inventory\") || !is_array(global.inventory) || array_length(global.inventory) !\u003d INVENTORY_SIZE) {\n                 show_debug_message(\"Load Game WARNING: Re-creating global.inventory to correct size (\" + string(INVENTORY_SIZE) + \").\");\n                 global.inventory \u003d array_create(INVENTORY_SIZE, -1);\n            }\n            // --- End Size Check ---\n\n            show_debug_message(\"Load Game: Copying \" + string(_copy_length) + \" inventory items from loaded array...\");\n            // --- Direct Copy Loop ---\n            for (var i \u003d 0; i \u003c _copy_length; i++) {\n                 // Ensure loaded value is a number before assigning, default to -1 otherwise\n                 global.inventory[i] \u003d is_real(_loaded_inv[i]) ? _loaded_inv[i] : -1;\n            }\n             // Fill remaining slots if loaded inventory was smaller than INVENTORY_SIZE\n             for (var i \u003d _copy_length; i \u003c INVENTORY_SIZE; i++) {\n                 global.inventory[i] \u003d -1;\n             }\n             // --- End Direct Copy ---\n            show_debug_message(\"Load Game: Inventory array copy complete.\");\n\n             // \u003c\u003c\u003c DEBUG: VERBOSE LOG OF FINAL GLOBAL INVENTORY \u003e\u003e\u003e\n             show_debug_message(\"Load Game DEBUG: Final Global Inventory Contents after load:\"); // Added \u0027after load\u0027\n             var _inv_string \u003d \"\";\n             for (var i\u003d0; i \u003c INVENTORY_SIZE; i++){\n                 // Extra safety check - should not happen if array size is correct\n                 if (i \u003e\u003d array_length(global.inventory)) {\n                    _inv_string +\u003d \"[ERROR: Index \" + string(i) + \" out of bounds!]\";\n                    break;\n                 }\n                 _inv_string +\u003d \"[\"+string(i)+\":\"+string(global.inventory[i])+\"]\";\n                 if ((i+1) % 10 \u003d\u003d 0) { // Print every 10 slots\n                     show_debug_message(_inv_string);\n                     _inv_string \u003d \"\";\n                 } else if (i \u003c INVENTORY_SIZE - 1) {\n                    _inv_string +\u003d \", \";\n                 }\n             }\n             if (_inv_string !\u003d \"\") show_debug_message(_inv_string); // Print remaining slots\n             // \u003c\u003c\u003c END DEBUG \u003e\u003e\u003e\n\n        } else {\n            throw \"Invalid \u0027inventory\u0027 data format (not an array).\";\n        }\n```\n\n*Self-Correction:* The logic in `scr_load_game.gml` for inventory *looks correct*. It reads the `_loaded_inv` array from the JSON structure and iterates through it, copying values into `global.inventory`. The debug logs confirm `_loaded_inv` is being read as `[-1, -1, ...]` from the save file. The subsequent loop correctly copies these -1s into `global.inventory`. This reinforces that the problem *is* in the save function - `global.inventory` must be empty *just before* it gets cloned/assigned in `scr_save_game`.\n\nLet\u0027s revisit `scr_save_game` one more time and the context where it\u0027s called. It\u0027s called from `obj_pause_menu` -\u003e `Step_2` event when the \"Save Game\" button is clicked.\n\n```gml\n// obj_pause_menu -\u003e Step_2.gml (End Step)\n// ... mouse/input handling ...\n\n// Handle menu selection with mouse click\nif (mouse_check_button_pressed(mb_left) \u0026\u0026 pos \u003e\u003d 0) {\n    switch (menu_level) {\n        case 0: // Main Pause Menu\n            switch (pos) {\n                // ... other cases ...\n                case 3: // Save Game\n                    // *** ADD DEBUG LOG HERE ***\n                    var _inv_debug_str \u003d \"Pause Menu DEBUG: Inventory state JUST BEFORE save call: [\";\n                    if (variable_global_exists(\"inventory\") \u0026\u0026 is_array(global.inventory)) {\n                        for(var i\u003d0; i\u003cmin(10, array_length(global.inventory)); i++) {\n                             _inv_debug_str +\u003d string(global.inventory[i]) + \",\";\n                        }\n                        if(array_length(global.inventory) \u003e 10) { _inv_debug_str +\u003d \"...\"; }\n                    } else {\n                        _inv_debug_str +\u003d \"ERROR: global.inventory missing/invalid!\";\n                    }\n                     _inv_debug_str +\u003d \"]\";\n                     show_debug_message(_inv_debug_str);\n                    // *** END DEBUG LOG ***\n                    save_game(); // Call the save function\n                    break; // Added missing break statement - might be important!\n            }\n            break;\n        case 1: // Settings Menu\n            // ...\n            break; // Added missing break statement - might be important!\n    }\n    // \u003c\u003c\u003c POTENTIAL ISSUE: Does anything happen *after* this switch but *before* save_game finishes?\n    // No, save_game is called directly within the case.\n}\n```\n\n*Self-Correction:* The inventory debug log added to `save_game` itself *already confirmed* that `global.inventory` is empty (`[-1,-1,...]`) when it reaches that point. Adding the log inside the pause menu confirms *exactly* what the state is when the save button is clicked. If *that* log shows an empty inventory, but earlier logs show items being added correctly, it implies `global.inventory` is being overwritten or cleared somewhere unexpected, *possibly* related to the UI interactions or pausing/unpausing logic itself. Could the inventory object be accidentally destroyed/recreated?\n\n**Final Plan:**\n\n1.  Fix `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room End` (`Other_5`) event to correctly save runtime room state without crashing.\n2.  Add the extra debug log to `obj_pause_menu`\u0027s `Step_2` event, right before calling `save_game`, to check inventory state at that exact moment.\n3.  Run the test again, paying close attention to both the pause menu debug log and the save_game debug log for inventory contents.\n\nLet\u0027s implement these two code changes.",

    }, {
      "text": "Okay, it seems we took one step forward and one step back. The good news is that saving *is* capturing the state of the objects in the room correctly now (like the truck and dropped toboggan), and it\u0027s also cloning the `global.inventory` array to prevent modification *during* the save process itself.\n\nHowever, two issues remain:\n\n1.  **Runtime Room Reset:** You are correct, the logs (`CONTROLLER ROOM START: Calling load_room_state for: ... (Is Fresh Load: 0)`) show that `load_room_state` is still being called when entering a room normally, but because `is_fresh_load` is false, it correctly *skips* destroying instances and *skips* loading the state array. **The problem isn\u0027t in `load_room_state` anymore**. The issue is that the instances from the previous room are simply being destroyed by GameMaker\u0027s default room transition behaviour because they aren\u0027t marked as `persistent`. When we save the runtime state in `obj_controller`\u0027s `Room End`, that state isn\u0027t being *applied* automatically when re-entering the room unless we load the game. This is actually the expected default behavior. To keep room states persistent *during runtime* without saving/loading, we\u0027d need a different approach (like making savable objects persistent and managing their visibility/position manually), but let\u0027s stick to fixing save/load first.\n\n2.  **Inventory Still Not Saving Correctly:** This is the critical issue.\n    *   The log `Pause Menu DEBUG: Inventory state JUST BEFORE save call: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,...]` is the absolute proof.\n    *   Even though items were added (`Inventory: Added \u0027Wrench\u0027`, `Inventory: Added \u0027Snow Shovel\u0027`, etc.), by the time you click the \"Save Game\" button in the pause menu, `global.inventory` is already empty.\n    *   The subsequent log `Save Game DEBUG: Inventory state before stringify: [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,...]` confirms the `save_game` function receives this already-empty array.\n\n**Diagnosis:** Something between adding items to the inventory and clicking the \"Save Game\" button in the pause menu is clearing `global.inventory`.\n\n**Where could this happen?**\n\n*   **`obj_pause_menu` Itself?** Does its Create event or Step event accidentally reset the inventory? Let\u0027s re-examine its Create event.\n*   **Other UI Interaction?** Could opening/closing another UI element (like the expanded HUD, though unlikely as it\u0027s closed when pause opens) trigger a reset?\n*   **`init_globals` called unexpectedly?** Although we prevent this during `is_loading_game`, could it be called somewhere else?\n*   **`obj_inventory` Being Destroyed/Recreated?** If `obj_inventory` (which *holds* the `inventory` array method scope points to, even if the array itself is global) gets destroyed and recreated, maybe the reference gets messed up? Unlikely since it\u0027s persistent and created by `obj_ui_manager`.\n\nLet\u0027s look at `obj_pause_menu`\u0027s `Create_0.gml` again:\n\n```gml\n// Create Event in obj_pause_menu\ndepth \u003d -99990; // Ensure pause menu is drawn on top\n// *** Does anything here reset inventory? *** No, it doesn\u0027t look like it.\nglobal.is_pause_menu_active \u003d false; // This seems wrong, shouldn\u0027t it be set to TRUE when created?\nglobal.inventory_visible \u003d false;\n\nimage_speed \u003d 0.5; // Menu animation speed\n\nop_border \u003d 8;\nop_space \u003d 16;\npos \u003d 0;\n\n// Pause menu options\noption[0, 0] \u003d \"Back to Game\";\n// ... other options ...\n\nmenu_level \u003d 0;\nop_length \u003d array_length(option[menu_level]);\n```\n\n**Correction \u0026 Next Step:**\n\n1.  **Fix `obj_pause_menu` Create Event:** The line `global.is_pause_menu_active \u003d false;` in the Create event is definitely wrong. When the pause menu object is created, the game *should* be paused. This might be interfering with state.\n2.  **Fix Runtime State Saving Crash:** The new crash `ds_exists argument 1 incorrect type (array) expecting a Number (YYGI32)` happens because the `Room End` event now *correctly* stores an array in `global.room_states`, but the code trying to check/delete the *old* data still assumes it might be a DS list.\n\n**Implementation - Stage 3: Fix Pause State and Room End Crash**\n\n**Step 3.1: Modify `obj_pause_menu` -\u003e `Create_0.gml`**\n\nChange the line that sets `global.is_pause_menu_active`.\n\n**Find:**\n\n```gml\nglobal.is_pause_menu_active \u003d false;\n```\n\n**Replace with:**\n\n```gml\nglobal.is_pause_menu_active \u003d true; // Pause should be active when this menu is created\n```\n\n**Step 3.2: Modify `obj_controller` -\u003e `Other_5.gml` (Room End Event)**\n\nCorrect the logic for handling the data stored in `global.room_states`. Since we now *always* store arrays, we don\u0027t need the `ds_exists` check anymore.\n\n**Find the function `save_runtime_room_state` inside this event and modify the storage part:**\n\n```gml\n// Inside the function save_runtime_room_state(room_asset_id)\n\n    // --- Store the generated state ARRAY ---\n    // --- CORRECTED LOGIC: Directly replace the map entry ---\n    // Remove any previous entry for this room first\n    ds_map_delete(global.room_states, _current_room_name);\n    // Add the new array\n    ds_map_add(global.room_states, _current_room_name, _state_array);\n    // --- END CORRECTION ---\n\n    show_debug_message(\"Stored runtime state ARRAY for room: \" + _current_room_name + \" (Size: \" + string(array_length(_state_array)) + \")\");\n}\n\n\n// --- Main Room End Logic ---\nif (!global.is_loading_game) {\n    save_runtime_room_state(room); // Use the helper function\n    show_debug_message(\"obj_controller Room End: Transitioning from room: \" + room_get_name(room));\n}\n\n```\n\n(Note: We removed the check for `_old_data` entirely. We just delete whatever might be under the key `_current_room_name` and add the new `_state_array`.)\n\n---\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1.  **Backup.**\n2.  **Modify `obj_pause_menu` Create Event (`Create_0.gml`)**: Change `global.is_pause_menu_active` to `true`.\n3.  **Modify `obj_controller` Room End Event (`Other_5.gml`)**: Update the storage logic within the `save_runtime_room_state` function as shown.\n4.  **Save** files.\n5.  **Clean Cache (`Ctrl+F7`).**\n6.  **Run and Test:**\n    *   **Runtime State:** Verify again that moving between rooms preserves dropped items/room states.\n    *   **Save Inventory:** Start a new game, add items to the inventory, open the pause menu, click Save. Check the **two** debug logs for inventory:\n        *   `Pause Menu DEBUG: Inventory state JUST BEFORE save call:`\n        *   `Save Game DEBUG: Inventory state before stringify:`\n        *   Do they *both* show the correct item indices now?\n    *   **Load Inventory:** If the save log looks correct, quit, load the game, and check the `Load Game DEBUG: Raw loaded inventory array:` log. Does it match the saved data? Is your inventory correct in-game?\n\nLet me know the results, particularly the inventory debug logs during the save process. This is the key to figuring out when the inventory gets cleared.",
